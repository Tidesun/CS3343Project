						  Situated at the  south-eastern tip of mainland China and in the heart of Asia, Hong Kong enjoys  an economic and strategic importance that exceeds its geographical size in an  area of only 1,105 square kilometres.<br />
</p>
						<p>With a population of approximately  7.34 million, Hong Kong is a densely populated city, comprising Hong Kong  Island, Kowloon Peninsula, and the New Territories. The average population  density was 6,780 people per square kilometre (as of 2016). Nonetheless, Hong  Kong is also known for its beautiful and well-managed country parks and greens,  located mainly in the New Territories and 262 outlying islands.<br />
						  </p>
						<p>English is the teaching  medium at most universities, including CityU, but both Chinese and English are  the official languages in Hong Kong. English is widely used within the  government and also by the legal, professional and business sectors. There is  no shortage of well-educated, competent bilingual or even trilingual  professionals who speak English, Cantonese and Putonghua.<br />

						<p><br />
						  During the summer months,  Hong Kong can get very hot and humid. Most indoor areas are air-conditioned,  including campus facilities. Winter temperatures can drop below 10°C (50°F) but  as cold spells are usually short, there is practically no central heating.<br />
</p>
						<p>Light clothing such as  T-shirts with jeans or skirts is appropriate for the summer while warmer  clothing such as sweaters, jackets or coats is required for the winter months.<br />
                        </p>

<h3><em>Class Arrangements under Adverse Weather  Conditions</em></h3>
                        <p>Tropical storms and  typhoons occur mainly between May and November. When there is a heavy rainstorm  or typhoon in the vicinity of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory will issue  different signals for weather conditions. The following signals and warnings  will be broadcasted on TV, radio and the University&rsquo;s homepage. For details on  the University&rsquo;s guidelines and arrangements when bad weather warnings are in  force, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/fmo/awa"><strong>https://www.cityu.edu.hk/fmo/awa</strong></a>.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p><u>Typhoon Signal No. 3:</u>&nbsp;<br />
                          A tropical cyclone is approaching Hong Kong, but most activities will be  unaffected.<br />
  </p>
                        <p><u>Typhoon Signal Pre-No. 8  and above:</u>&nbsp;<br />
                          A tropical cyclone is close to Hong Kong and may hit the territory directly.  All activities including work, school and outdoor activities should cease.  People should stay indoors.<br />
  </p>
                        <p><u>Rainstorm Amber or Red  Warning:</u>&nbsp;<br />
                          Heavy rain is expected and will affect some areas. All CityU outdoor activities  will be cancelled. Most indoor activities remain unaffected.<br />
  </p>
                        <p><u>Rainstorm Black Warning:</u>&nbsp;<br />
                          Intense and heavy rainfall is expected. Activities should cease and people  should stay indoors when the warning is announced.<br />
  <br />
                        </p>
                        <h2>Health and Safety</h2>
                        <p>Compared to many other  places in the world, Hong Kong is clean and safe. No vaccinations or injections  are officially required. Nevertheless, people in Hong Kong are vigilant about  flu prevention, especially during the peak season for influenza from January to  March and July to August every year. For more information, visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dh.gov.hk/" target="_blank"><strong>Department of Health</strong></a>&nbsp;website. During flu  seasons, don&rsquo;t be surprised when you see people wearing face masks. They do so  to prevent the spread of germs. <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>Tap water in Hong Kong is  not fit for drinking. You are advised to drink boiled water or water from  drinking water fountains. Bottled mineral or distilled water is available at  the food outlets on campus, convenience stores and supermarkets.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>Smoking is prohibited in  most indoor areas, including the CityU campus and Student Residence, malls,  restaurants, karaoke lounges and bars and some outdoor areas such as public  beaches and swimming pools, transport interchanges and outdoor escalators. Any  person who smokes or carries a lighted tobacco product in a statutory  no-smoking area commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a maximum  fine of HK$5,000. For detail, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tco.gov.hk/" target="_blank"><strong>Tobacco Control Office</strong></a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dh.gov.hk/" target="_blank"><strong>Department of Health</strong></a>.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>In an effort to keep Hong  Kong clean, any person caught littering or spitting faces a fixed penalty of  HK$1,500.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>Armed violence and  serious crime rates are comparatively low in Hong Kong. However, it is in your  best interests to remain vigilant at all times regarding your personal safety.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>Petty crimes are common  in tourist spots such as Lan Kwai Fong, Wan Chai, Causeway Bay and Mong Kok.  Always hang out with people you can trust, especially when clubbing and in  bars, and always stay in groups.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>Beware of pickpockets on  public transport, especially the MTR. Coffee shops, student canteens and  libraries are also areas in which thefts are common. Do not leave your personal  computer, mobile phone or other belongings unattended. To report the loss of  identity documents or objects of value to the police, call&nbsp;(852) 2860 2000&nbsp;or&nbsp;(852) 2527 7177.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>Hong Kong has left-hand  traffic. Always check on your right-hand side before crossing the road. While  waiting for the signals to change before crossing the road, please be patient.  Though it may be tempting to cross the road if there is no traffic, it is not  worth the risk for a few seconds.<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>In case of an emergency,  call one of the following 24-hour hotlines for help:&nbsp;<br />
                          - Police/Fire/Ambulance:&nbsp;999&nbsp;<br />
                          - CityU Campus Security:&nbsp;(852) 3442 8888&nbsp;<br />
                          - Student Residence Security:&nbsp;(852) 3442 1999 <br />
                          <br />
                        </p>
                        <h2>Electricity</h2>
                        <p>The standard electrical voltage  in Hong Kong is 220 volts AC, 50 Hz. The majority of electrical sockets allow  the use of three-pronged plugs. Voltage transformers and adaptors are widely  available and can be purchased in most convenience stores, supermarkets and  even the canteen at the Student Residence.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/gso/welcome/image/socket.jpg" width="300"/></p>
						<br />
						<h2 id="cult">Culture</h2>
						<p>With a population that is mainly ethnic Chinese and a special historical background, Hong Kong is a global city in which Chinese traditions intertwine harmoniously with Western culture. You will find multiple denominations of  churches sharing space with Chinese joss houses, temples, mosques, and synagogues. It is not surprising to see elderly residents playing ancient Chinese board games on digital tablets. In Hong Kong, people celebrate the Christmas and Easter holidays with the same fervour as they enjoy Buddha’s Birthday and Chinese New Year. Hong Kong is also an inclusive and innovative city where state-of-the-art skyscrapers are designed in consultation with Feng Shui masters. </p>
