<p><i>“Don’t listen to what people say, just go and see…!”</i></p>

<p>“My name is Muhammad Sajjad and I’m from Pakistan. I am also a PHD fellow at School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong and I am going to stay in Hong Kong for the next three years for my PhD studies”. This is my self-introduction that I have repeatedly saying for many times in my first-month of stay here in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Before I came to Hong Kong, I stayed in the Xiamen city of Fujian Province in China for two years during my Masters. Xiamen is considered one of the most beautiful cities in China and the experiences I got during my stay there were remarkable as this was the first time for me to be out of my own country for such a long time and notably, alone. I must say that I was a bit scared to think if I would be able to adjust myself well on a foreign land at the beginning. However, I did, and I did that well.</p>

<p>During my stay in Xiamen, I always heard from my friends about their visits to Hong Kong and that was how I was inspired by the fantasies of this city in the first place. I tried to make plans to visit many times but somehow all these plans did not work out. Luckily, just upon graduation of my Master’s degree, I got the admission offer from CityU! I booked my tickets and packed my bags. On August 25 2017, I finally got to see this Pearl of the Orient for the first time in my life.</p>

<p>Well! For me, arriving in Hong Kong felt very much like putting on the best pair of shoes you’ve ever worn during your whole life on this planet. Although I have previous experience living in China and I felt that I already learnt the tips and tricks to adjust to a new place, I have to admit that it still took me a while until I feel settled here in Hong Kong. However, adjustment became very easy when I found two things that satisfy me well: firstly, unlike in Mainland China where I did not meet a lot of people from Pakistan, the most satisfying thing for me here in Hong Kong is that I got to meet a bunch of country mates both on campus and in places outside of the university; secondly, almost every food of my country is available here in Hong Kong with the same delicious taste just like at home.</p>

<p><strong>My Favorites</strong></p>

<p>I have spent a lot of time walking around the city. This habit of mine has always helped me explore the diversity in life style, culture, food and environment of a particular place. Before I came to Hong Kong, during my stay in Mainland China, I heard a lot of people saying that Hong Kong was a small place with too many people where everything is congested to a certain level. As I came to the city and explored it myself, I found most of the descriptions I heard was biased and I actually found that in many ways, the city suites me and life here is what I was looking for.</p>

<p>As everyone knows, finding an accommodation is one of the biggest challenges in Hong Kong especially when you are a student. I am also facing this problem, however, as I am becoming more and more familiar with this place, I believe I will get my own apartment very soon. Though I have just been here for a month, I can say that Hong Kong is a diverse place in each and every aspect. On the day I came here, I didn’t know a soul here but now, I got some friends from different countries. This makes me feel more satisfied and as time passes, I believe that Hong Kong will be just like home to me.</p>

<p><u>Those Places I Like at CityU</u></p>

<p>The CityU has played an important role introducing me to this place, of course. The campus is amazingly situated in urban area with almost all the facilities one can expect from any place. It’s actually quite difficult for me to talk about my favorite places at CityU, as there are bunch of places such as the lounge in Run Run Shaw Library for its comfort, and Garden Cafe near Jockey Club House (JCH) for its distinctive taste of Cappuccino. However, if I have to pick one place only, my most favorite place at CityU is the Lau Ming Wai Academic Building, which is also called Academic Building 3 (AC3). There are quite a lot of reasons for why I love this place but in nutshell, the spectacular design of this building has inspired me a lot and the open space of this building below its front edge is an excellent point for people to get relaxed and have a catchy view of the campus especially in the evening.</p>

<p><u>Tsim Sha Tsui Waterfront: A Symphony of Lights</u></p>

<p>I came to the waterfront at Tsim Sha Tsui without any former planning while I was walking around the area a couple of days after I arrived in Hong Kong. I didn’t even know the name of this place at that time. The place is fascinating enough to attract one’s attention and make people visit repeatedly. From the day I got to know this place, I visit it almost every night to feel the fresh air and gaze this spectacular view.</p>

<p>At the waterfront, there is also a light show called <i>“Symphony of Lights”</i> every night and in peak travel season of the city, thousands of tourists would come to see the show. It is said to be the world’s largest permanent light and sound show, according to the <i>Guinness World Records</i>. Though the area could get very crowded, the show is still one of the finest things I have experienced until today in Hong Kong and I agree that the Hong Kong skyline is inarguably one of the most spectacular in the world, especially at night when the city puts on this stunning laser show with a perfect harmony of music. </p>

<br><i>The spectacular view of Victoria Harbour at the waterfront at Tsim Sha Tsui (By SAJJAD Muhammad)</i></center></p>

<p>I have only come to the city for a month but the city has already moved me just like it impresses everyone who visits this place for the very first time. I will be living here for almost three years (and who knows if the time will be longer or not…=J ) and there is a long way to go. At least, now I have something to recommend to my friends who are just planning to visit Hong Kong.</p>

<p><i>Collect moments and not the things</i>, this is what I believe. Being a geographer, I just love travelling, sometimes without any plan. I believe that sometimes unexpected things in life would turn out to be the most memorable and lovely. I would always look forward to joining people to go out, have some fun and experience as much as possible. I would encourage everybody to do so!</p>
