            <p>Have you ever thought about what you would do in university? Or what you want to do in life? How will you find your own personal goals, your dreams—even yourself?</p>
            
            <p>I used to ask myself similar questions. Then I realized that unless I actually started exploring different things, I would probably never find answers to these questions. That’s why in this academic year, I went to the University of Tasmania as an exchange student and spent one whole semester in Australia.</p>
            
            <p>In Australia, the semester starts in early July and ends in Mid-November. Therefore, for those of you who are considering visiting Australia in Semester A, you have to start preparing immediately after finishing Semester B at CityU! No worries! I believe the majority of you will be as excited as I was after your exchange application is accepted.</p>
                      
            <p>Tasmania is in the southern part of Australia and has a low population density. Unlike in Hong Kong, public transportation in Tasmania is not very convenient and the distances between places feel longer. Waiting 30 minutes for a bus is common, and on weekends, if you miss a bus, you may have to wait for two hours for the next bus to arrive. However, you may enjoy the relaxing atmosphere of this quiet city, as I did. You can spend more time thinking about things under the blue clear sky. I found myself thinking more about myself, my future, my family, and the city I live in.</p>

		        <i>The peaceful and relaxing atmosphere in Tasmania gave me lots of time to think about my future and family.</i>
            </center></p>
            
            <p>It can be a big challenge to go overseas without any direct support from family, friends, or your home university. You may have worries, or you may have no idea about what you are going to do. Sometimes, you may even wonder what the future will be like. In my case, the exchange program helped me put myself out there and pushed me to deal with new challenges.</p>
            
            <p>Meeting new friends was one of the biggest challenges I faced during the exchange program. One of the goals I set for myself when I joined the exchange program was to expand my social network. I made up my mind to try my best to communicate with the different people I met. However, when I first settled down in Tasmania, I felt defeated and lost. Many of the students I met were interested in drinking beer, dancing, and windsurfing, and unfortunately, none of these activities really attracted me. I tried to go with them sometimes, but I would also maintain a comfortable distance. Gradually, I became friends with people with whom I shared common interests. Luckily, with a minor in Japanese Studies, I was able to make friends with some Japanese students in Tasmania—we did a lot of things together and even joined a cooking class! After we finished our exchange program in Australia, my Japanese friends very kindly accompanied me on my visit to Japan. Does this count as “friendship without borders”?</p>

		        <i>In the dormitory, lots of activities were arranged to help students make friends with each other.</i>
            </center></p>

		        <i>The cooking class I joined was definitely one of my favorite activities. Through cooking, all of the participants got to learn about different cuisines and unique recipes..</i>
            </center></p>
            
            <p>As soon as you start to process your exchange application, you will realize that you need to deal with differences—different application systems, different teaching methods, different arrangements for adding/dropping classes… The list goes on and on. Dealing with these differences can be stressful, because most of the time, you are not sure what to do.</p>
            
            <p>Course enrolment was very stressful at the beginning of my exchange program. Unlike in CityU, the list of course offerings at the University of Tasmania is not available until two months before the semester started, so when I was looking for courses to put into my study plan during the application period, I struggled to find the right courses. I learnt to be patient as I waited for the email replies from my host university’s coordinator and eventually settled on a successful study plan.</p>
                       
            <p>The teaching methods at the University of Tasmania were different from those used at CityU. In Hong Kong, we do not have video lectures. In Australia, although some courses are offered face-to-face, some are offered as video lectures. The lecturers who present these video lectures are available for in-person appointments if students have questions about the course content. As the university is made up of several campuses, when the same course is offered at two campuses, discussion sessions are arranged via video calls, enabling lecturers and students to connect and share thoughts on topics relevant to the course.</p>

		        <i>The orientation programme offered by the university was a great way to learn about the university and its student body.</i>
            </center></p>

		        <i>I took a Japanese class at the University of Tasmania and it actually became my favorite course of the semester! It was quite different from the Japanese classes I took back in Hong Kong, as my classmates’ mother tongues were not Chinese.</i>
            </center></p>
                        
            <p>I stayed in Tasmania for four months, and the new environment and new experiences encouraged me to think about and pay attention to surroundings that I had neglected in the past. When I was alone, I realized that I really missed some of the things I had back in Hong Kong: there are some things that had seemed to be not so important that became important when I was abroad. I finally understood why some people say simple things are the most valuable.</p>
            
            <p>My exchange program at the University of Tasmania was completed on 14 November 2017. After the semester, I took some time to travel across Australia and explore the beauty of that country. When my plane landed in Hong Kong, I realized that this study abroad experience is going to be an important part of my life—the first step in exploring the world and understanding more about myself.</p>
