<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>When I was in secondary school, I always imagined what life would be like if I could go overseas for studying. Would I be courageous, independent, and comfortable immersing myself in different cultures to understand how other people live?</p>

<p>As a junior in college, it’s time to turn my imagination into reality and share my experiences with anyone who wishes to go on exchange. Korean pop culture is so influential among college students these days. There’s no denial that I admire Korean pop stars and have also been learning Korean as a hobby. Quite naturally, Korea was my first choice in my exchange application. Instead of just learning Korean from textbooks, I really wanted to explore Korean culture in person, or even meet some KPOP idols face-to-face if lucky enough!</p>

<p>Alright, of course studying abroad is not just about meeting celebrities. It’s also about studying and experiencing a different university. As a chemistry student, I would also like to see if learning chemistry in Korea is different to that in Hong Kong. Luckily, I was admitted by the ‘Korean MIT’, Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). So let me tell you how classes are like at this prestigious Korean university!</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog29_01.jpg" width="400" /><br>
<i>This is the entrance of Department of Chemistry at KAIST. They have a few buildings for classrooms and laboratories. This is only one of them!</i></center></p>

<p>Like its name, the university specializes in science and technology. Most courses are conducted in English, but you occasionally may encounter one or two professors who don’t teach in English, even though the course is listed to be taught in English. Unfortunately, I met one of these professors. Although I have acquired entry-level Korean, I have not mastered enough of the language to understand a college-level class. As a result, I had to apply for a new course and arranged my study plan for credit transfer all over again.</p>

<p><u>Learning Atmosphere</u></p>

<p>As KAIST aims to train students as future scientists and researchers, quite often professors encourage students to actively participate in class, rather than solely receiving knowledge from one end. Taking an instance, one of my professors at KAIST didn’t even provide any lecture notes or textbooks. At every class, this professor told us to link what we had learnt before and generate ideas related to the new topic for that particular class. Admittedly, I am not really into this teaching style, but it was mind-blowing experience and beyond my imagination.</p>

<p>That said, students here are eager to ask and answer questions during class. The intensity and frequency of interaction between teachers and students for class discussions actually impressed me. Though most students ask questions in Korean – because it’s probably easier for them to illustrate in their native language – professors sometimes translate their answers into English to help foreign students. Also, soon after the semester started, I realized that Korean students tend to take notes by themselves instead of just making use of lecture notes prepared by the professor. Apart from lecture notes, in KAIST, textbooks are used much more often than in Hong Kong, and nearly 80% of students bring their own textbooks to lectures. Back in Hong Kong, the majority of students only bring lecture notes to class. In this case, I almost felt like a minority here.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog29_02.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>A typical KAIST lecture theatre. This is where we spent most of our time for lectures at KAIST.</i></center></p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog29_03.jpg" width="400" /><br>

<p><u>Class Schedule</u></p>

<p>One thing that I really like about KAIST is my class schedule. My classes are 90 minutes long, starting from 9:00 am, 10:30 am, 1:00 pm or 2:30 pm. When I was planning my timetable after course registration, I found that it was actually very easy because there were fewer time clashes.</p>

<p>There is also a lunch break from noon to 1:00 pm when there are no classes scheduled. At the beginning, I was worried that the canteens would be very crowded because everyone has lunch during the same hour.</p>

<p>It was only a 10-minute walk between the canteen and where I usually had classes. Although it is true that almost every student had lunch during this hour, I was always able to find a seat at the canteen to finish lunch on time and walk back to class without any rush. Wondering why? In this 1,432,882 m2 campus, there are 18 different cafeterias serving different types of cuisines to all students and staff members.</p>

<p><u>Food in KAIST</u></p>

<p>The main cafeteria (Kaimaru), in particular, is where most students have their meals throughout the day. It functions like a food court, with different caterers providing various cuisines such as traditional Korean, Chinese, and Japanese. Some of the set meals can be rather expensive, costing around KRW5,500 (about HKD40) per set. If you have a limited budget, there is also a stall that sells a-la-carte food and rice, which is similar to the double-dish rice we have at CityU canteens. What’s different is that in Kaimaru, dishes are sold at different prices – rather than at a fixed price – so you can always choose cheaper dishes. In my experience, around KRW3,000 (around HKD22) would be enough to fill your stomach with two dishes, a bowl of rice, and soup or a soft drink. What’s more, there are daily specials which cost KRW4,000 (around HK$30) and the options are usually an omelette, rice, spaghetti, barbequed beef bibimbap, or udon soup. Personally, canteen foods at KAIST are very affordable, delicious, and include many options. As such, I never got bored of going to the same place every day!</p>

<p><u>Dormitory</u></p>

<p>There are tons of dormitory buildings in KAIST. All foreign students (including exchange students) reside in the same building, which is located at the west side of the campus. Two students share one room, which has an individual shower and toilet. Korea is not a small country, and KAIST’s campus is very spacious compared to university campuses in Hong Kong. Dormitory rooms are also much larger than those in Hong Kong. On even-numbered floors – where I am living – there is a lounge equipped with a microwave oven and a water fountain. On odd-numbered floors, there are laundry rooms with two washing machines and one dryer. Residents can use the washing machines for free but if they want to use the dryer, they must pay KRW 1,000 (around HK$7) each time.</p>

<p>Cooking is not allowed in the dormitories. If residents are hungry, their only options are cafeterias, delivery service, or visiting the convenient store in the basement.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog29_04.jpg" width="400" /><br>
<i>The International Scholar & Student Services office (ISSS) in KAIST will help each international student apply for the dormitory on their behalves. This room was my home during my 4-month stay at KAIST.</i></center></p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog29_05.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>Cooking is not allowed in most KAIST dormitories. Luckily the food delivery service in Korea is very good, so you can just call, sit back, and… Bon Appétit!</i></center></p>

<p><u>On-campus Transportation</u></p>

<p>As mentioned above, KAIST has a very large campus. It takes around 30 minutes to walk from the west end to the east end. The classrooms are also dispersed from the north-eastern to south-eastern side of the campus. Therefore, you might need to rush if you have to travel between different buildings for classes that are within 10-15 minutes of each other. There is also a campus shuttle bus for students and staff, which arrives every 10 to 20 minutes. Hence, many students ride a bike or even a motorcycle to shorten their travel time on campus.</p>

<p><u>Livelihood beyond Campus</u></p>

<p>KAIST is located in Daejeon, which is known as the 'great field’. Daejeon is more of a peaceful residential city than a metropolitan hub for business people and travellers. To be honest, KAIST feels like an isolated island compared to CityU. It is extremely convenient for CityU students to travel throughout Hong Kong as the MTR station is only five minutes’ walk from the university. Having studied in such a convenient environment for nearly three years, I found it hard getting used to living in Daejeon. The reason is that travelling to other places is very difficult as public transportation is not easily accessible. The closest subway station is 30 minutes’ walk from my dormitory and there are only a few buses that stop at KAIST.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog29_06.jpg" width="400" /><br>
<i>Daejeon has only one subway line so not many places can be reached by subway. I enjoyed not being squashed like sardines on the subway, even during rush hour.</i></center></p>

<p>But if you travel to the most crowded area in Daejeon, Eunhaeng-dong, which is near Daejeon Station, you can find almost all international brands such as Nike and Zara as well as cosmetic brands including Etude House and Innisfree, and there is an underground market that sells cheap clothes. Eunhaeng-dong is probably the best place for shopaholics to spend their day. In my opinion, this is not a shopping paradise when compared to Mong Kok but you can find something that we don’t have in Mong Kok - the Michelin-listed bakery, Sung Sim Dang. It is famous for its Twigim soboro (fried streusel), which looks similar to Hong Kong’s pineapple bun, but filled with red bean paste.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog29_07.jpg" width="400" /><br>
<i>Enjoying dessert at a café in Eunhaeng-dong with another Hong Kong girl that I met in KAIST!</i></center></p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog29_08.jpg" width="400" /><br>
<i>Many people who visit Sung Sim Dang buy Twigim soboro (of course I’m one of them). The bakery even has a corner inside the shop for selling this particular pastry!</i></center></p>

<p>If you are too lazy to go to Eunhaeng-dong for shopping, a Lotte supermarket is just 10 minutes away and a large-scale Homeplus department store is 20 minutes away from the university. Although daily necessities can mostly be found inside campus stores, a wider range of goods can be bought from Homeplus, such as food, drinks, stationery, and even electronics. I am sure all the necessary items to survive can be found in these places.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! I hope you all have a better idea about what it is like to study at KAIST. I will share more about my exchange study with you soon. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Best,
<br>Silvia Kwok</p>
