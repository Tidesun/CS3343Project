<p>Prior to departure, students who are going abroad for an exchange study should prepare to the best of their ability. This ranges from researching about their host university, to determining what essentials to pack in their luggage. For instance, one should research about the weather in their host country to decide what clothes to take; about the transportation system so that he or she is prepared when the plane lands; and class arrangements including what it may be like for students to adapt to the new learning environment. </p>

<p>I was aware of all of these steps and prepared as much as I could before leaving for Denmark, the exchange destination for my one-semester exchange study. However, I realized that even though I had a very comprehensive plan, I needed to prepare myself for the unexpected.</p>

<p>The start of my exchange life in Aarhus, Denmark was tough. I had never imagined that it would turn into a nightmare.</p>

<p>To reach Aarhus, I had to make 2 stops during my flight: from Hong Kong to Helsinki, Helsinki to Copenhagen, and then finally, from Copenhagen to Aarhus. As I bought the flight ticket for my final leg to Aarhus with a separate airline, I had to retrieve my luggage and drop it off at the check-in counter before boarding at Copenhagen.</p>

<p>If all flights were on schedule, I should have had 1.5 hours to make my connection, however, my flight from Helsinki was delayed due to adverse weather. As a result, I had only 30 minutes to catch my flight at Copenhagen. This meant I didn’t have enough time to retrieve my luggage and drop it off for check-in. Therefore, I had only two options: (1) to forget about my luggage and get on the flight which was leaving in 30 minutes; or (2) to retrieve my luggage and wait for the next flight to Aarhus. I checked the residence check-in schedule at my host university and realized that if I waited for next flight, I would miss the opening hours of the international center, meaning I would have no place to stay for the first night in Aarhus.</p>

<p>I thought about what I had packed in my luggage and evaluated to what extent I would be affected if I leave my suitcases behind, as a worst case scenario. After much deliberation, I decided to leave the suitcases in Copenhagen Airport and rushed to the gate to catch my scheduled flight. (Well, thinking back I am not sure whether it was a good decision or not, but who knows what would have happened if I decided to wait for the second flight.) Luckily, I arrived in Aarhus safely and checked in with time to spare in my dormitory.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog28_01.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>Safely landed at Aarhus Airport</i></center></p>

<p>Once I had settled down in Aarhus, I started to search for my luggage. I sent emails to the baggage handler of the airline and gave my luggage details: the world-tracer numbers, the brand and design of the luggage. (I later found out from the airline that in this kind of scenario, it would be very helpful if a photo of the luggage is available.) I felt extremely lucky when the baggage handler told me that they had found my luggage with the information that I provided and they were to send it to Aarhus Airport (AAR) on the same day.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if my problems were solved so easily, I wouldn’t be writing about this here. Once the sun rose, I travelled on an hour ride to AAR from my host university with the intention of collecting my luggage. However, upon arriving at the service counter, I was informed by the ground staff at the airport that my luggage has been mistakenly sent to Aalborg Airport (AAL) instead of AAR. I would have to wait a further day to be reunited with my luggage.</p>

<i>Friendly airport bus driver sent us back to the city center and showed us where to get some warm food when most of the stores were already closed</i></center></p>

<p>Although I appreciated the help from the airline staff, I was extremely disappointed and not to mention exhausted after 20 hours of travel from Hong Kong to Aarhus. Throughout the city, all the shops were already closed and without a blanket and pillow, I had to rely on my thin jacket to keep me comfortable through my first night in Denmark. Although my dormitory room was equipped with heater, it was still a chilly night.</p>

<i>First night in my dorm</i></center></p>

<p>Finally, the next morning, with the help of staff members at Aarhus airport, I received my luggage. I was very grateful for their assistance, their warm and friendly help made me feel welcomed in this new country. </p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog28_04.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>Our happy faces after getting back the suitcases</i></center></p>

<p>Reminiscing on this experience and the very cold first night in Aarhus, I realize that sometimes being strong is the only choice you have. My exchange study has only just begun and although I am hopeful everything will turn out to be great, I believe this won’t be my only challenge in this journey. Stay tuned for more sharing from me!</p>

<p>Here are some tips for you to avoid the plight that I had:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pack a small set of clothes and personal care requisites in your hand-carry bag. In case your luggage is lost or delayed, things you have in your hand-carry bag will help you ‘survive’! Of course, be mindful of the amount of liquids, aerosols and gels you are allowed to bring on board the plane (which, usually, is around 100ml/item).</li>

<li>If you are traveling in winter, don’t leave all your warm, comfortable clothes in your suitcase. The last thing you want is to fall sick so far away from home!</li>

<li>Keep host university contacts with you at all times so that you can reach out for help in times of need.</li>
</ol>
