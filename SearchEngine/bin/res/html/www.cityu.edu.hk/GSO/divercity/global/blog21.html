		    <p>Talking about Myanmar, what will pop-up in your mind? “Underdeveloped”, “complicated ethnic issues”, or “regional conflicts”? There is probably very little information, but most of which may be not so positive. When I applied for the Myanmar service learning program, although my curiosity and desire to explore this scarcely revealed country wasn’t knocked down by the confrontations happening there, both worry and excitement kept intertwining in my mind. With limited information available about Myanmar, anxiety remained even until the pre-training session was over. At that time, I could have never imagined how the trip would go and what I would experience and see in a country like Myanmar.</p>
            
            <p>In summer 2017, I joined a service learning trip to Myanmar with 11 other students. In a total of 28 days, we stayed in Mandalay, the second largest city in Myanmar and during week days, we served as volunteer teachers in Phaung Daw Oo Monastic School (PDO). On the weekends, we organized 3 cultural visits for ourselves to walk around and explore Myanmar. Both the service we did and the visits should enable us to learn about the country’s culture, history, religions and education.</p>
            
            <p><b>“Oh my God, such a difficult hike with bare feet!”</b></p>
            
            <p>We arrived at Mandalay on June 5th. After settling down in Hotel Mandalay, we went out and enjoyed our first meal in Myanmar style. The first week was prepared for discussions with local teachers in PDO about details of teaching at the school. We also got to observe how these local teachers taught their students to get an idea how we should manage our classes.</p>
            
            <p>On the first weekend in Mandalay, we paid our first cultural visit to Bagan. Among all the places of interest, I had a higher expectation towards Mont Popa, an extinct volcano with numerous temples on its top. The name Popa comes from Pali, “the Buddha’s language”. Popa means flower, indicating the mountain’s stunning scenery and its role as a pilgrimage destination. When arriving at the foot of the mountain, our team was so astonished to know that removing shoes and socks before entering Buddhist shrines is a must according to local etiquette. Therefore, even for foreign visitors, shoes and socks must be taken off before they take the stairs to the relic sites atop, high up in the clouds.</p>

            <p>My hike to the top of Mont Popa began in reluctance, but it ended with relief and a sense of realization. By respecting the local culture and carefully observing and following what pilgrims do to prevent causing disturbance, we tried to make ourselves comfortable and to feel what local pilgrims feel— we experienced the toil of climbing to the top of the holy mountain and we witnessed their devotion to belief. The view from the top was breath-taking as all the relics were built beside a cliff. It was hard to imagine the scope of work and the dedication made to build the stairs under such extreme condition. Looking around, there was an unlimited view, wild and solemn. The songs of praying sounded graceful and mystery, echoing in the fresh air, as if they were from a distant past, travelling through the river of time.</p>

            <p><b>“You know what, the shyest little girl in our class, she smiled to me and hugged me today!”</b></p>
            
            <p>Our service in Phaung Daw Oo Monastic School (PDO) as volunteer teachers started in the second week. PDO was founded in 1993 by a monk, Mr. U Nayaka, who aimed to provide free education to poor students. The school itself was a legend as it started with only around 400 students and staff members, but it has been expanded rapidly in the past two decades. Now, PDO has around 9,000 students and staff members, its service covering education from kindergarten to high school.</p>
            
            <p>During training session, we 12 participants were divided to 3 groups and our task then was to prepare for teaching subjects of English, Integrated Humanity, and Creative Thinking. In our first week at PDO, we discussed with local teachers to finalize our teaching schedule and roster so that each of us would have responsible classes to teach. Everything happened just as we planned until we started teaching in class with a room of students to manage.</p>

            <p>As members of English group, my partner and I were in charge of KG2 (Kindergarten Class 2) for their 3 morning classes. The biggest challenge was that our students were young kids who had just come to school for their first time - 3 days ago, to be exact. These kids’ first language ability was still limited, not to mention their knowledge of English. Since we knew nothing about their mother tongue, at the beginning, my partner and I had to rely much on images we prepared, body language and the translation provided by local teachers who were assisting us in classroom to communicate with the students.</p>
            
            <p>In our first class, every kid behaved quite well, but they also seemed to be a little bit confused and fearful. However, as we spent more time together, the kids began to show who they really were and in the third class of the first morning of teaching, some kids were too excited to calm down and wanted more attention, while the rather shy ones just stayed in silence even when we led them to read after us. Among all the kids I was teaching, there was a little girl who was very shy. I remembered her watery eyes blinking and looking at me but she never smiled or came close to me the entire time of the 3 classes I taught that day.</p>
            
            <p>The first day of teaching was far from satisfactory to me and my partner. Thanks to the feedback from local teachers and the suggestions collected in our team’s de-briefing session, I realized there were two main problems in our classroom management: firstly, every kid needed equal attention, but I could not split myself up to fulfil each of them; secondly, the kids were so clever and energetic and I did not know how to manage them. How could I give enough attention to each student with my limited energy and inspire them to use their energy to explore and to learn? Is there a teaching method for me to adopt that would help boost the kids’ interests in learning?</p>

            </center></p>
            
            <p>After brainstorming with my partner and consulting with the local teachers, I decided to integrate board games into my classes and everyone in class could take turn to play, with the possibility to win gifts. Computers were also brought into the classroom to show the kids songs, videos and cartoons made for learning. At the same time, local teachers continued to assist us with translating the teaching content into local language and helped students review what we taught in their classes. The outcome was rewarding — before our departure, my littles kids were able to use some of the vocabularies they learnt in class to try talking with us. During every class break, they would run to me and share their snacks with me, amongst whom there was the shyest cute girl with watery eyes. I later found out she had a very beautiful name, Rose.</p>

            <p>Unique customs, unforgettable sceneries, exotic food, charming people… These were what I had thought about experiencing in this trip to Myanmar and I had prepared myself for them. What I didn’t and couldn’t expect was how I would feel when I finally got to see, to listen and to understand in person. There were uncomfortable moments and even moments of misunderstanding, but in my heart this experience was warm and I would always remember the sunshine in Mandalay, the kids I taught, the places I had visited and the people I had met.</p>

            <p>When looking at the countries and regions rarely heard, especially those being categorized as “developing countries or regions”, we tend to pay more of our attention to the negative aspects instead of finding out and appreciating the beauties. It sometimes requires us to look beyond common descriptions and misrepresentations to find out the beauty and charm and when we do, we learn to be humble.</p>

            <p>By doing service in Myanmar, we aimed to bring our ideas and thoughts to inspire local educators and students, but we ended up gaining much friendship and inspiration from them and getting to know more about ourselves. Just as what Aung San Suu Kyi said, “Kindness, can change the lives of people. By helping others, you will learn how to help yourself”.</p>
            
            <p><b>Notes: Three Unique Facts about Myanmar</b></p>
            
            <p>Through research and conversations with local Myanmarese I met during this trip, I learnt a lot about the country, its culture and society and its people. Here I would like to share three unique facts about Myanmar:</p>
            
            <p><u>Thanaka, The Yellowish Cosmetic Paste</u></p>
            
            <p>In Myanmar, local people put a yellowish paste on their faces to prevent themselves getting sunburnt. This special type of cosmetic paste is called thanaka, which is made from the thanaka tree bark. By adding water to the grinded thanaka bark, a creamy texture can be created and this is basically how the thanaka paste is made. Local Myanmarese usually apply the thanaka paste on their faces, creating attractive designs of patterns. Local parents may pattern the cosmetic paste in shapes of cute animals on their children’s faces. This special kind of sunblock not only provides a cooling sensation, but also has the effects of removing acne and smothing skin, which is why it has been used widely by Myanmarese people.</p>

            </center></p>
            
            <p><u>The Buddhist Monastic School System</u></p>
            
            <p>The Buddhist monastic school system in Myanmar has a very long history, which can be dated back to the 11th century. Now, the monastic school education and the government school education form a unique education system of Myanmar, each with its own benefits to offer. The Phang Daw Oo Monastic School (PDO), which is the school I served in Myanmar, is one of the most well-known monastics schools in the country. The funding of a school like PDO mainly comes from the donations and collaborations from the public, rather than just from the government. Monastic schools act to provide education for children from needy families, including orphans. Their teaching not only aims at helping students with their literacy and numeracy skills, but also emphasizes on laying their ethics and moral foundation. Compared to that in government schools, the teaching at monastic schools is more flexible and unconstrained. For example, in PDO, the school motto is “Free Thought and Freedom” and the local teachers would encourage students to get creative and to learn to express their own opinions.</p>
            
            <p><u>Buddhism in Myanmar</u></p>
            
            <p>Myanmar is known as the hidden kingdom of Buddha. In this country, Buddhism is not the only religion but it definitely is a major one here. Although no religion has been recognized as being in a dominant position, the current government definitely shows a preference to the Theravada Buddhism and there have been profound impacts of Buddhism in this country. According to the Myanmar Census 2014, Christiany has been the second largest practiced religion in Myanmar, followed by Islam and Hinduism.</p>
