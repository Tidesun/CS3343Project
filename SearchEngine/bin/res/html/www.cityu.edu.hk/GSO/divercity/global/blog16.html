		    <p><strong>WHAT?</strong> The Extreme Environments Programme was created to take students to remote and endangered ecosystems in order for the students to make site-specific art that couldn’t have been created without nature.</p>
            
            <p><strong>WHO?</strong> More than a handful Creative Media students, supported by State Key Laboratory in Marine Pollution and the Nature Conservancy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>WHERE?</strong> One part of the group went to the Solomon Islands, while the other part went to Mabul Island, Malaysia.</p>
            
            <p><strong>WHEN?</strong> The Coral Triangle – Mabul Island Programme took place between the 26th of February and the 8th of March in 2017. The exhibition of the artworks that were created during the trip or based on the data gathered during the trip was open to the public from the 18th of April until the 25th, displayed in the Creative Media Centre, under the title “Deep Focus”.</p> 
            
            <p>You know that there is something special about a journey when you cannot sleep a blink the night before. And you know that there is something incredibly special about a journey when you have so many things to do before you leave that even if you wanted to sleep during the night, you just cannot.</p>
            
            <p>Travelling to Malaysia with the Extreme Environments programme belonged to the aforementioned second category. When I left for the Hong Kong International airport, at exactly 5 am in the morning on a Sunday after a frantic night of packing and crossing a handful of items off my to-do list, I was already exhausted. Truth be told, I was so exhausted that I can’t recall much from the car ride to Lantau Island, apart from the lights of the sleeping city flickering around us, and the buzzing of the tires against the asphalt. If I am perfectly honest with myself, I have to admit, I was not sure what to expect of this trip; uneasiness and anticipation had a tight grip around my throat. And we had a long way to go – we only arrived to Malaysia a day later, after transferring in Kuala Lumpur and spending the night in Tawau.</p>
            
            <p>After we departed from Tawau the next morning, the last segment of our travel involved taking a boat from the city until Mabul. We had to wait about half an hour on the busy pier, watching ships whizz by the makeshift town that looked as though it was floating on the water. Everyone on the jetty seemed to mind their own, everyday business, making it easy for me to observe them. An old man with raspy voice and breath that smelled like cigarettes was selling jewellery made out of the mother of pearl, carved in the shapes of sea turtles, rays, and shark fangs. A mother with tanned skin and a bright orange linen-shirt was carrying heavy water bottles and plastic grocery bags; her daughter’s hand was clinging onto hers and a second-hand doll clad in a neon pink dress. When I smiled at the little girl, she just gave me and my camera a suspicious, wide-eyed look. At that time, I didn’t understand why; so I just got on the boat with a shrug.</p>
            
            <p><center>

            </center></p>
            
            <p>The ship we took was small and crowded with the baggage and people on its slippery linoleum deck. Raindrops were tinkling down the metal railings and with every wave, more and more sea water splashed onto the polished white seats, our wet clothes, and our faces. After a while we got used to continuously batting our eyes, to protect it from the wind shoving against our skin. It was quite the challenge to try to commemorate every moment of it with the dangling camera in my hand, and at one point I accepted my defeat and just leaned back on my seat and enjoyed the ride.</p>
            
            <p><center>

            </center></p>
            
            <p>Once we arrived to the island, all of us were left speechless. Mabul provided such a stark contrast to Hong Kong in every way: the city noises were completely absent. There were no cars honking, no traffic lights clicking, or school bells ringing. You could only hear the sounds of nature: the birds chirping, the waves crashing against the shore, and the wind rattling the leaves. The skyscrapers were nowhere to be seen, it was only the tiny rosewood cottages peeking at you from between the trees. The Hong Kong crowd was replaced by tourists of our diving resort wandering on the path filled with sand and pebbles, leaving their footprints behind; just like the Komodo dragons roaming freely across the island left waveforms on the sand drawn by their tails. When we went to take pictures on the creaking wooden staves of the pier, we could easily spot all the corals, the schools of fish, and threatening gangs of sea urchins in the crystal clear water – the low visibility of Hong Kong waters seemed like a distant memory. Everything seemed perfect.</p>
            
            <p>But staying on Mabul for almost ten days showed how flawed our first impressions were. We met the unattended children on the island who live in the slums that are right next to the diving resort. They would ask us for our money, cameras, and food. Strolling around the island showed the unimaginable wealth gap that exists in society and it reminded us that we were not on a holiday; and that the reason why we could enjoy the cleanliness of the resort and its good food was because right next to us people were enduring penury.</p>
            
            <p><center>

            </center></p>
                        
            <p>Normally, I’m a very outspoken person, yet when I think about explaining what the experiences that I have gained during this trip mean to me, the words die on my lips, and I just stare blankly at my laptop’s screen. Experiencing harsh realities of the real world, while practicing the extreme activity of scuba diving have been an impactful combination. Especially because during scuba diving, when there is only the fish and the coral, water pressing against my body, the sensation of weightlessness, and the sound of my breath and the bubbles, I really did feel like I was in a different universe, away from all the issues of reality.</p>
            
            <p><center>
		        <img src="image/photo/blog16_04.png" width="600" />
            </center></p>
            
            <p>The only time I was reminded of such problems was when we went diving to one of the highest ranked diving sights of the whole ocean, the Sipadan Island. Diving in Sipadan showed us the true richness of underwater ecosystem, and shined light on how important it is to conserve them. The life underwater does not resemble the world we are used to, at all: it is a world where all creatures live together in a perfectly choreographed manner. A world where the old turtles know when they will die and swim to a cave called the “Turtle Tomb” before they pass away. A world where the fish are born knowing that they have to swim in a formation. A world where the sharks, the same sharks that are supposed to be hostile predators according to the sensationalist media, are sleeping soundly on the seabed, or are retreating peacefully into the deep (with other fish sleeping on their backs) when divers swim too close to them.</p> 
            
            <p>The Extreme Environments Programme provided me with a once in a lifetime and with memories so unique I can never forget about. I can only hope that more people can realize how important underwater ecosystems are and how much we depend on it, and will help these endangered environments to persist in the future.</p>
