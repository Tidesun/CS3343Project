						<p>
						For Melody, it was a practical choice for her to go on an exchange to Cardiff University in her last semester before graduating with a degree in Policy Studies and Administration from the Department of Public Policy in 2008. Her six-month experience as an overseas student was a great opportunity, the kind one typically dreams about pursuing after graduation. 
						</p>
						<p>
						As she recalled, ‘I was quite lucky to get my first job at Wing Lung Bank upon returning from the UK’. Handling complaint cases and investigations arising from the default of Lehman-linked ‘minibonds’, she admitted it was a busy and stressful position, ‘because people would call and scold you when you were trying to address their issues’.
						</p>
						<p>
						Melody’s second job was in risk management at Hang Seng Bank. After two years of experience in both risk and compliance, she is now in her third job as Assistant Compliance Manager at Dah Sing Bank. ‘In fact, I am considering taking up studying again - Master of Law if possible’.
						</p>
						<p>
						It sounds like Melody has had a very fortunate and smooth career path. Perhaps it is her good-natured personality and well-mannered ways or her insightful thoughts and informed knowledge, but behind her genuine smile was a rewarding worldview shaped by the different countries she had visited and the people she had met during her time at university.
						</p>
						<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog05_02.jpg" width="400" /></center></p>
						
						<p>‘You would be surprised by what a difference a university education can have in a person’s life, and not just due to exposure abroad’, she said. Sharing her observations of her colleagues over the past few years, she notices that people with a good university education tend to have acquired a certain kind of critical and analytical skill set. ‘It is quite interesting to note that in Hong Kong, most senior staff or people in professional positions had actually all been on exchange or studied abroad as a tertiary student. Maybe they do appreciate people who have this world exposure after all, compared to someone who hasn’t been out of the country much.’</p>
						<p>
						What Melody is referring to is not just intellectual intelligence, but also practical and social intelligence gained from the basic understanding of people from different backgrounds that she developed at Cardiff which, interestingly, started in a funny way. 
						</p>
						<p>
						One night, she and two friends were cooking fish in the common kitchen. The dish had an intense smell that the locals did not like. The next morning, they found themselves locked in their respective rooms from the outside, until one friend came to let them out. ‘It was obviously a fun and friendly prank the locals pulled, because they continued to hang out with us and we continued to make fish dishes.’
						</p>
						<p>
						Apart from locals, Melody also met other friends who taught her about people’s preferences, boundaries and perspectives. For example, she noticed that her Japanese friends were very considerate and full of social graces in terms of living in a public space, whereas the locals believed in self-responsibility. In a kitchen setting, they felt that people who washed a dirty dish were entitled to use it, even if it did not belong to them.
						</p>
						<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog05_03.jpg" width="600" /></center></p>
						
						<p>‘Understanding people’s way of life helps better prepare you for the future’, Melody said. This is especially true when it comes to her observation of Italians and their morning espresso habit. One time when she was still at Hang Seng Bank, she had the Risk Management team prepare an espresso for an Italian client, and he was so surprised and happy. ‘It was obviously not related to my profession, but it definitely helped.’</p>
						<p>
						Another time, when Melody and her friends arrived at Cardiff at 9 pm on a freezing cold winter night, they were in luck (again?) because Melody knew an exchange student from Cardiff who was also a buddy for the CityU International Friends Club. He was so kind and rescued them (and their luggage) in a very small car. ‘At work, your role is to help your corporate to solve problems, not to create more. Throughout my exchange, from finding the way (to Cardiff University) or trying to get Internet access (when Wi-Fi was not as accessible then), everything was accomplished by thinking of solutions myself.’ 
						</p>
						<p>
						This event and many other small trips to other European countries has given Melody enough experience to know the importance of a well-laid plan, and subconsciously it is already something she has gained that has made her stand out from her peers in the earlier stages of her career, including the art of contrary thinking. ‘Being on exchange allows you to meet more friends and see more things from different perspectives.’ 
						</p>
						<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog05_04.jpg" width="600" /></center></p>
						
						<p>Melody Yuen, on exchange to Cardiff University in her final year of study back in 2008, met friends from around the world. She still keeps in touch with her international friends. ‘It was a very good experience and remains a source of great memories that I will always treasure.’</p>
