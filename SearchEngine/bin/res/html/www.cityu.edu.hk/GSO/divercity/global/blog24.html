              				</div>
	       				 </div>


            <p>As a college student born and raised in Hong Kong, I always thought about stepping out of my comfort zone and spending some time in an unfamiliar place to immerse myself in ‘differences’. As a communication major, I was also curious about the media industry outside Hong Kong and how my peer students in the same major study in other parts of the world.</p>
            
            <p>For many people, their impressions about Singapore might come with skyscrapers along the coast (just like those in Hong Kong), the well-known Merlion as the city’s mascot, and a densely populated urban landscape. Many people would agree that as cosmopolitan cities and regional business hubs, Hong Kong and Singapore share many similarities. If I wanted to step out of my comfort zone, why did I choose Singapore for exchange study?</p>
            
            <p>The answer is simple—because of the city’s cultural diversity. Ethnic Chinese play a dominant role in Singaporean society, and over 70% of the country’s residents are of Chinese descent. Located at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, with its own colonial history, Singapore is highly influenced by Malay and other Southeast Asian cultures. The country embraces an English-based bilingual education system, with English taught as the first language and Mandarin Chinese, Malay, and Tamil as major second languages for students from different ethnic backgrounds. For me, Singapore as an English-speaking country is highly influenced by Western cultures and values, but simultaneously contains a blend of Asian values.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Learning about Others and Myself</strong></p>
            
            <p>“Elitism,” which is considered the foundation of success, was the impression I held of Singaporeans in the past. I thought that many Singaporeans took it as a bible that everyone has an equal chance to climb to the top of the social ladder as long as they work hard, so they grew up believing that if they wanted to succeed, they needed to study and work hard.</p>
            
            <p>This impression turned out to be very biased. The students I met at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) were energetic and zealous. They were active in joining various school activities and involved in organizing activities to help students connect and build friendships. Nationality, or whether you are a local or an exchange student, does not matter at NTU—the students welcome you to join them to enjoy good food and fun games together.</p>
            
            <p>The “Colour Games” is undoubtedly one of the annual highlights of NTU’s student activities and one of my top recommendations if you choose NTU as your exchange host institution. Picture yourself throwing balls and spraying others with coloured powder. You can barely imagine how much mess the coloured powder can make! “Believe me, no matter who you are – a sports-lover or a genuine introvert, you will fall in love with the ‘Colour Games,’ as it’s a great chance for you to chill out with other students and release your emotions,” a local NTU student told me.</p>
            
            <p><center>

		        <i>Our t-shirts were stained with coloured powder after the “Colour Games” but nobody really cared how dirty we actually were.</i>
            </center></p>
            
            <p>Now, you are probably wondering what my learning experience in Singapore was like. Like typical CityU students, I acquired practical knowledge in lectures, took part in discussions among students, and worked hard on group projects in Singapore. However, if I have to talk about differences, NTU’s curriculum particularly emphasizes connecting knowledge with real-world practice via field trips or mini-lectures by guest speakers working in the industry. It’s really fun seeing how you can apply what you have learnt in classes to the real world.</p>
            
            <p>As a communication student, I was very lucky to get a taste of working as a reporter on a finance desk by taking “Business Journalism” at NTU. It widened my horizons when we were taught how to scrutinize income statements and extract numbers from government statistics and databases. We even got hands-on experience in newswriting with “scary and stressful” deadlines—in journalism, missing a deadline is inexcusable because it means your audience will have no content to look at.</p>
            
            <p>My classmates and I were also given a chance to visit the Bloomberg office in Singapore as part of this course. Having worked at Radio Television Hong Kong as an intern reporter, I knew how diligent journalists are, and a real newsroom was nothing new, but the Bloomberg reporters I met and their working environment made me realize how enthusiastic I actually was about this challenging profession.</p>

            </center></p>
            
            <p><strong>The Greatest Gift</strong></p>
            
            <p>In Singapore and especially at NTU, I was fortunate to meet so many hospitable and easygoing local students. In a foreign country, you might sometimes experience culture shock and loneliness. At the beginning, when I tried to mingle with them, I thought some of the local students were a bit shy and passive. But after a few months when I hung out with them more, and I unknowingly picked up and used a lot of Singlish colloquial terms such as “lah” and “lor” in conversations, the bonding grew tighter. I started to realize that once you started talking like the local students, they reciprocated very warmly, because they saw that you were trying to blend in. This made our friendship more sincere and long-lasting. I feel lucky to have had these local friends who helped me overcome such challenges and gradually adapt to Singapore’s lifestyle.</p>

		        <i>My friends in Singapore took me to a lot of different places after classes.</i>
            </center></p>
            
            <p>I still remember how my Singaporean friends prepared a special birthday surprise for me. That day, we were together chit-chatting as we usually did after class. Suddenly, all the lights were turned off and one of my friends took a big box out of his bag. I thought, “Wow! How nice! They are celebrating my birthday and I have a birthday cake.” But it caught me by surprise! It was a box of fruit, not a birthday cake. But still the little surprise warmed my heart. For me, this “fruity” birthday celebration was strange, but definitely heart-melting.</p>
            
            <p><center>

		        <i>Instead of a cake, I got a box of fruit from my friends for my birthday.</i>
            </center></p>
            
            <p><strong>“Shiok”</strong></p>
            
            <p>The 4-month exchange trip flew past in a blink of an eye. If I could only use one word to describe my time in Singapore, I would use the Singlish term “shiok,” which represents a feeling of sheer pleasure and happiness (it’s like “cool” and “awesome” in English).</p>
                       
            <p>Back home in the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong, I feel no regret about visiting Singapore when flipping through pictures on my smartphone. For me, it was not just an academic exchange, but also a cultural immersion. Although the journey has ended, the fond memories and strong friendships remain.</p>
            
            <p>Last but not least, I have something to share with you. The world is so big and our lives are so short, there’s no point staying in one spot. Believe me, go somewhere and explore how big the world is.</p>
