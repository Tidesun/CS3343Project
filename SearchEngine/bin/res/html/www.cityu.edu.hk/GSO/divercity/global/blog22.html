            <p>Tokyo has always been ranked among the top three most popular travel destinations for Hong Kong people. Having lived in Osaka for several years during my childhood, I always wanted to spend some time in Tokyo and experience the differences between Japan’s passionate West (Osaka) and speedy East (Tokyo). This is why I applied for the exchange study program at Waseda University in the first place.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Learning @ Waseda</strong></p>
            
            <p>Waseda University is one of the best universities in Japan. Studying politics at Waseda has been a totally different experience from that in CityU. The School of Political Science and Economics (PSE) is the best school in Waseda. In addition to regular Japanese-taught programs, PSE also offers the English-based Degree Studies September Admission Program (EDESSA) for international students and Japanese returnees who studied or grew up abroad.</p>
            
            <p>Students in the EDESSA program were passionate about learning, eager to explore and willing to take up challenges. Encouraged by my fellow students in the program, I became more active in my interactions with both classmates and lecturers. In Hong Kong, I was not a very active student; I preferred to simply listen to the lecturer and study the textbooks. In Waseda, there was no break for a three-hour class, and in class, there was no one-way lecturing. I soon realized that sitting still in the classroom and merely listening to what the lecturer said would not help me fully understand the context of the issues discussed. Instead, speaking up and exchanging ideas with the students and lecturers became an interactive and effective way to help me reflect on what I had learned in class while allowing others to hear my ideas and allowing me to elevate my learning progress.</p>
            
            <p><center><img src="image/photo/blog22_01.jpg" width="650" /></center></p>
            
            <p>Ms. Hirakawa, who taught the Global Asia Seminar at Waseda, said, “Learning should not be unpleasant.” Her seminars provided me with rich and comprehensive knowledge on Chinese, US and Japanese foreign diplomatic policies. Moreover, her friendliness, kindness and understanding warmed my heart so much, especially during the days in Tokyo when I felt most challenged. The close relationships between teachers and students are a strong benefit of studying at Waseda University.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cultural Shock 1: Transportation in Tokyo</strong></p>
            
            <p>Tokyo has the busiest transport system and the most complicated railway system in the world. During my stay in this metropolis, I had to rely heavily on the railway system for my commute. In my daily routine, I took the Keikyu Line and Yamanote Line of the Japan Railway (JR) and the Tozai Line of the Tokyo Metro System. Almost every day, I had to spend an hour getting to Waseda, as I was living in Shinagawa with my host family, while Waseda is in Shinjuku. I had to travel across several districts to go to class.</p>
            <p>If you cannot stand how crowded Admiralty is, then do not try to take the JR Yamanote Line, especially during peak hours. One morning, I had no time to finish my breakfast at home before I left for my 9 am class, so I brought my bread with me in my backpack. On the train, I could not breathe and I could not move, not even to turn my head. I was relieved when I finally got off the train, but I was shocked to find that the bread in my backpack had been pressed as thin as a piece of paper! The degree of crowding on the train was beyond description.</p>
            
            <p><center><img src="image/photo/blog22_02.jpg" width="650" /></center></p>
            
            <p>After five months of such intensive “training” in Tokyo, my commuting life as a sardine has prepared me for peak-hour commuting in any metropolis in the world. Thankfully, Admiralty is no longer a threat to me. The crowdedness of Tokyo’s public transportation was far beyond what I could imagine!</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cultural Shock 2: Girls’ Makeup Culture</strong></p> 
                                   
            <p>Another big cultural shock in Tokyo was the makeup culture among the young ladies there. Girls in Tokyo are always well-dressed and wear full makeup. In Hong Kong, girls wearing such outfits and makeup would be considered “in battling mode” (戰鬥格) for a special occasion. In Tokyo, however, dressing well and having makeup on are ways that Japanese girls show respect to others. I was amazed by the variety of makeup tools carried by Japanese ladies inside their tiny handbags.</p>
            
            <p>My girlfriends in Japan told me that they could never go out without makeup. Suppin is the Japanese term meaning “wearing no makeup,” and according to my friends, suppin is as embarrassing as wearing no clothes in public. Although this is probably an exaggeration, it reflects how important one’s appearance is in Japanese society. This is probably why toilets in Japan are translated “restrooms” instead of “washrooms,” as people also use restrooms to refresh and fix their makeup, hair and outfit. Electrical sockets are commonly found in restrooms so that restroom users can charge their hairdryers or other devices to tidy up! I was amazed how my friends in Waseda did their full makeup and hairstyling in the restroom during the 15-minute break between classes. I know that the Japanese are very mindful of etiquette, but their requirements of decency were definitely beyond expectations!</p>

            <p><strong>The Chickenpox Challenge</strong></p> 
            
            <p>The most unforgettable experience during my adventure in Tokyo was suffering from chickenpox. I was admitted to the hospital and was isolated for a week. After being discharged from the hospital, I maintained self-isolation in a hotel because I was afraid that I might spread the disease to my host family, especially to the 8-year-old boy and the 1-year-old baby girl. The two weeks of isolation were much too lonely, but it was a good opportunity for me to learn how to take care of myself. My family had spoiled me too much in the past, and away from their care and love, I panicked when I got sick and was admitted to the hospital in Tokyo. Fortunately, the love and care from my host family filled the hole in my heart, especially after I completed my self-isolation in the hotel. There were times of loneliness and worry, but thankfully, I met people in Japan whose warmth and kindness made me feel secure even when I was away from home!</p>
            
            <p><center><img src="image/photo/blog22_04.jpg" width="650" /></center></p>
            
            <p>The five months I stayed in Tokyo were an adventure. Everything was new, and many things were unexpected. I was shocked and challenged sometimes, but I also learned a lot along the way. I would encourage everyone to step out of their comfort zone and challenge themselves with some adventure in life!</p>
