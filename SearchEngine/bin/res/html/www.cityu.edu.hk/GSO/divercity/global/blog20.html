		    <p><i>“Where is it?”</i><br>
            <i>“Why do you choose this country as your exchange destination?”</i></p>
            
            <p>These kind of questions had been asked frequently to me when I got the exchange offer to study in Vilnius University in Lithuania. I understand it is probably uncommon to choose Lithuania as an exchange destination. Afterall, Lithuania is still a strange and unfamiliar name to many people in Hong Kong.</p>
            
            <p>I became enthusiastic about the European War history when I was 16 years old. Like many Hong Kong students who took history classes in secondary schools, the first time I heard about Lithuania was when I learnt about the formation and dissolution of Soviet Union during the Cold War. Lithuania was the first country to gain independence from the Communist power. I thought going to Lithuania for study would fulfill my curiosity about the history of Lithuania and enable me to learn about the mysterious stories in the Baltic region. As a student majoring Culture and Heritage Management in CityU, through learning the Lithuanian language, I wanted to understand the Lithuanian culture, such as the food, the people and the traditions, and more importantly, how Lithuania strove to raise its power in Europe and shine itself on the global stage, both economically and culturally.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Life in Vilnius</strong></p>
            
            <p>My first exchange study started in the frigid weather of Lithuania, the pearl of the Baltic. The first impression I had about Vilnius is that I was surrounded by snow and historical buildings. Compared to other Western and Central European countries, the price level in Lithuania, even in the capital city, was expectedly low. This really made my exchange life free of the anxiety about overspending.</p>               
                       
            <p>As I became familiar with Vilnius, I realized that the simplicity of the city was actually the most impressive thing. The old town of Vilnius is small but the government invests and makes a lot of effort to make it a UNESCO heritage site. I really appreciate the way the government in such a tiny country strives to preserve the original face of its old town for the local people and the newcomers. Along Gediminas Street (the main street) during holidays and weekends, there is always a festival or a celebration for people to share their joy.</p>
            
            <p>Although in Vilnius you probably cannot find something comparable to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, or the beautiful rivers in Budapest, you can find an old town that really is a place to relax and feel the history of a post-Soviet Union state. I feel grateful for having been able to experience it. In the souvenir street, Pilies Gatve, you can find things like stamps, postcards and military costumes that were made in the USSR. They are nothing luxurious but they are the simplest things for people to remember a state’s history as a result of the great Communist power.</p>

            <p><strong>Overcoming Challenges: Weather and Food</strong></p>
            
            <p>If you ask me what has been the most challenging thing I encountered in Lithuania, I would say that both the extremely cold weather and the food were challenging. As I mentioned, Lithuania is not a rich or very developed country, the dormitory and its electricity supply are not as good as those in Hong Kong. The heater in my room never fully warmed up the room while it was −21 °C outside and I had to convince myself that this was the way Lithuanians saved energy in winter.</p>
            
            <p>In such an unfamiliar weather, still, if I wanted to look for food, I had to walk along the street. As the times I dined out accumulated, I realized that the signature food for Lithuanian are only potato and beet root soup. It took me 4 months to get used to the potato meals there. Although it’s still not very fulfilling for me to be on a diet consisting of such limited food choices, I would say potato is really a healthy food and such diet indeed is effective to keep the body warm in a cold winter.</p>

            <p><strong>My Lithuanian Buddies</strong></p>
           
            <p>Vilnius University is one of the oldest and largest university in the Baltic States since the 16th Century and also one of the oldest in Northern Europe. Some exchange students I met at Vilnius University would say the Lithuanian are cold and they do not like smiling in general. I disagree with this claim because I met some amazing and cool Lithuanian buddies at the university.</p>
            
            <p>The first one is my mentor assigned by school, Silvija Kalandarišvili. Silvija is half Russian and half Lithuanian. We took the same course in Oriental Studies and because of this, we had more opportunities to meet and to get to know each other. She was very interested in Chinese language and culture, therefore sometimes we would exchange our perspectives on Chinese and Lithuanian cultures and even taught each other our mother tongues. From her I learnt more about the modern relationship between Russian and Lithuanian in the Soviet Union history and the different ethnicities of the two nations.</p>

		        <i>The first day I met my mentor, Silvija</i>
            </center></p>
            
            <p>The other Lithuanian best friend I want to introduce here is Andrius Skirkevičius. Andrius was my group mate in several classes and I was shocked for a while the day I met him because of his fluent Mandarin Chinese. I appreciated him very much for his effort to learn Chinese and it was amazing to be able to talk to a local person in Lithuania in Mandarin. As an exchange student myself, I felt inspired by his journey to Taipei, Taiwan for his exchange study. We talked a lot about cultural and economic differences between Taiwan (or Asia at large) and Lithuania, for example, while the serious air pollution in Asia caused by the uncontrolled economic growth was something he felt hard to tolerate, Andrius liked the kindness and friendliness of Asian people, comparing to the “cold” Lithuanian.</p>

            <p><strong>Five Personal Observations</strong></p>
            
            <p>Lastly, I would like to share FIVE observations I got from my exchange study to those who are considering study abroad in Lithuania:</p>
            
            <ul><li>Lithuania can be super cold in winter, so wear as much as you can! The lowest temperature I experienced is -26 Degree Celsius.</li>
            
            <li>Lithuanians do not hate Russian, but when some of them do, they may refrain from speaking Russian! P.S. Some people in Lithuania do not speak English, so if you are planning to go for study in Lithuania, learn some basic Lithuanian before you go.</li>
            
            <li>Compared to that in Hong Kong, I found the working style to be more “casual” in Lithuania. For example, the office hour for the Immigration Office where I applied for my student visa is from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00a.m.! Besides, professors can cancel a whole course the day before the semester starts.</li>
            
            <li>The university dormitory costs only around 50 EURO per month.</li>
            
            <li>Lithuanians’ favorite food is POTATO! Get ready to eat potato everyday!</li></ul>
