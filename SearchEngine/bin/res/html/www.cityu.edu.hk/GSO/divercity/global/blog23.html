            <p><strong>Internship Experience: More than Just Work</strong></p>
            
            <p>As summer was approaching, I was burdened with the realisation that I needed to get something to do for 3 months, or I would end up wasting time back in my hometown, Indonesia, binging on Netflix and chocolates. My plan was to find an internship, whether it be in Hong Kong, or back in Indonesia. I believe that internship is something that every student should do at least once in university life. It gets you ready for the work environment, and more than just the hard skills, you get to experience and learn soft skills that will enhance your career prospectus. Luckily, just as I was looking at the different internship job advertisements, I saw the university’s promotion for the Global Work Attachment Programme- a programme organised by CityU’s Career Leadership Centre enabling student participants to do an internship abroad. I tried my luck and applied for their Sydney programme.</p>
            
            <p>My internship was with a digital marketing company called Marketing Bee in Sydney and I was supervised directly by the CEO, Sharon Latour. I worked on content creation, photography, budgeting and financing, and even styling a photoshoot. It was great that I had the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge into real world situations and also got to channel my creativity! From Sharon and this internship, I learnt that building your own company comes with a lot of risk and responsibilities—you are required to make quick and sometimes hard decisions, and you have to be in control of everyone and everything around you. Not everyone can live up to the expectation that is required from a startup company if they don’t have the passion that follows. Sharon inspired me to be courageous and start up my own business. Her drive and work ethic in working towards something she is genuinely passionate about moved me and I am convinced that even in a male-dominated industry if you have the passion and the strength to push through and persevere, you will be successful.</p>

		        <i>My workplace is so diverse - my supervisors are from Mauritius and Italy, and my coworkers from the States and Hong Kong!</i>
            </center></p>

		        <i>Working on a food photoshoot - maybe someday I could make use of my photoshoot styling talent to start a business.</i>
            </center></p>
            
            <p>Just like a lot of college students, I attend a lot of recruitment talks and do as much preparation as possible to prepare myself for a career after graduation—and to be honest, the thought of meeting high executives, and working for a big corporate still intrigues me. I definitely would still want to experience working in a corporate environment for a few years because I’m sure I can learn from it. Looking at this internship, one most significant takeaway for me is that “you should stick to what you love doing”. As cliché as it sounds, money comes and goes, and at the end of the day, if you are doing a 9 to 5 job that you hate, and you are complaining about it every day and night, then you're just floating by. Sharon’s advice and the experience I got in this internship reaffirmed that life is too precious for anybody to just float by.</p>

            <p><strong>Discovering Australia</strong></p>
            
            <p>If Hong Kong is a city that never sleeps, Australia is a city that sleeps early. Shops and malls close business at 6 pm, except on Thursdays, when their service is open till 10pm. It is inconvenient at times, but I managed to learn to get used to it. Australia ranks high up in countries with the best quality of life, and it makes sense because the country obviously doesn’t overwork their citizens. When shops and malls are closed, the only thing you can do after work is to go home, cook dinner and enjoy time with your family!</p>
            
            <p><center>
		        <img src="image/photo/blog23_05.jpg" width="650" /> <br>
		        <i>Sydney can be very energetic, but there are also very quiet and peaceful corners where you can take a moment to breathe and relax.</i>
            </center></p>
            
            <p>In Australia, I got to try out solo travelling for the first time in my life. My previous roommate is an advocate for solo travelling as she believes it’s the best me-time for her to reflect and think clearly. I went to Melbourne excited, hoping that I would get the me-time that I never experienced, but sadly, after a few hours being alone, I feel incredibly lonely and wish I had someone to talk to on the phone. It’s not all bad though! The best part of travelling alone is the freedom to choose wherever you want to go without having to ask for the approval of others.</p>
            
            <p>In Melbourne, I spend most of my time café hopping and trying out new food. I’ve turned a few questioning heads whenever I asked the waitress for a table of one, but I honestly loved it! There’s no waiting line since they would offer me a seat at the corner and I would be left alone with a plate of food and a book in hand, enjoying my alone time. At the end of my trip, I was happy I was able to experience something new and out of my comfort zone. I wouldn’t personally go on another solo tour, but I would recommend it for the experience to those who haven’t.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Discovering Life: Meeting and Learning from New People</strong></p>                        
            <p>Living with other people from the programme has taught me to be considerate and to look at situations through other people’s shoes. Having lived in Hong Kong for over two years, I have grown to be independent. From having your meals cooked every day, not having to do the laundry, and being driven everywhere, my first few months in Hong Kong was tough. Adapting to a new place is no longer a big challenge for me. However, it might be a challenge to other people who have never gone abroad before. Some people struggle with homesickness, and sometimes their emotions get the best of them. In Sydney, there were times when conflicts occurred because people did not communicate, and the misunderstanding progressed into a bigger conflict than what it actually was.</p>
            
            <p>My biggest advice to people who are facing similar situations is: communicate. Often, we expect people to understand and tolerate how we feel, but we forget that they have their internal conflicts as well. It takes courage to show vulnerability to other people, but the first step to solving any problem is to communicate openly. Sometimes people do not express their discontent due to fear of confrontation, but if you are respectful and kind, people will do the same. At the end of the day, it’s not who wins the argument, but who can be the bigger person to put away the ego to resolve the conflict.</p>
            
            <p>My internship to Sydney has also opened my eyes to a new group of people living in Hong Kong—international kids who have lived all their life in Hong Kong but never felt quite at home because of their identity. These people, now friends I hold close to heart, told me about their struggles living in Hong Kong. They face discrimination and sometimes injustice due to their race, but they have grown to become stronger despite the hardship. I resonate with this because growing up as a Chinese-Indonesian, I am in a strange middle ground. I am an Indonesian because of the culture in which I was brought up, but I can never be too Indonesian because of my complexion and race. It is weird for me to have to negotiate an identity as both a Chinese and an Indonesian when I am not exactly either but kind of both.</p>
            
            <p>The world has a long way to go until it is able to eradicate all kinds of prejudice, however, until that time comes, I believe that everyone should be able to identify as whoever they want to be. Labels or no labels, I believe that we should be proud of who we are, no matter where we come from.</p>            
         
            <p><strong>It’s so much more than just a trip!</strong></p>
            
            <p>At the end of my trip in Sydney, I was grateful for all the memories I collected over the months. I got to meet new people and make memories with them. I had my first experience of crashing at a friend’s place after a house party, and I learnt that you couldn't compare the comfort of sleeping in bed with warmers to a cold sofa. Looking back at it, these are the memories that made the trip so memorable and fun! I also get to experience an entirely new culture. Australia reminds me a bit of Indonesia, with its inaccessible places and kind people who are willing to help. It was a nice change to be able to live in a place where language was not a barrier. I also got to experience a real workplace environment and how to react in certain situations that I might encounter in an office in the future, and this has prepared me for such future battles. Most importantly, I bonded and created a deep friendship with new people who are now a part of my life. I came to Australia excited for what was ahead of me, and it certainly did not disappoint.</p>
