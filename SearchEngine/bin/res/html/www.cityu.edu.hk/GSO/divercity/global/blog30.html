<p>Growing up in a cosmopolitan city like Hong Kong, we are familiar with cultures from the East and the West. However, I wonder how many people in Hong Kong know what life is like in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Middle East is always described as the mysterious. People often relate this area with danger, poverty and war. In many people’s perception, Middle East has nothing associated with advancement. It will be quite surprising for a lot of people who don’t know much about the Middle East that Israel, as one of the most developed countries in the Middle East region, is in fact a leading country in many areas such as entrepreneur development, technology and architecture globally.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog30_01.jpg" width="650" /></center></p>

<p>I am interested in Middle East affairs, especially on topics like war and peace. If student exchange programme is one of the few opportunities I could get as a college student to step out of my comfort zone and experience something entirely new and exciting, I’d like to make full use of it. This is why despite safety concerns, I still chose Jerusalem as my exchange destination.</p>

<p>As one of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem has more than 3,000 years of history. Three major religions in the world, Christianity, Islam and Judaism, consider this place as holy land. It is a rare opportunity to study and live in a sacred city like Jerusalem</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog30_02.png" width="570" /><br>
<i>Western Wall, a remaining segment of the Second Temple. It is a holy place to the Jews. Jewish people usually pray in front of the wall as they believe it is the closest place to God.</i></center></p>

<p><u>Living in Jerusalem</u></p>

<p>With Israel as a Jewish state, Judaism is the major religion in Israel. There are many Jewish festivals throughout the year. </p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog30_03.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>A large group of Orthodox Jew in their traditional costume</i></center></p>

<p>Shabbat begins at sunset every Friday and ends after the sunset on Saturday. It is a tradition to remember the Biblical creation of the earth in six days and rest on the seventh day.</p>

<p>ALL shops and restaurants (Yes, ALL) close on Shabbat. Even the public transport is suspended to honour the day. People refrain from work activities, go to synagogue (the Jewish house of prayer), pray and read the Torah. Orthodox and Conservative Jews strictly follow the rule on Shabbat that the use of electricity and automobiles are prohibited. On the day of Shabbat, Jews love to spend time with family. On the street, you can see people putting down their electronic devices, walking along the light rail track, spending quality times with their love ones.</p>

<p>Although Shabbat may seem inconvenient to those of us who are used to the modern way of living, I do enjoy the day. I can’t help thinking, if it can be applied in Hong Kong where busy city life is the norm, shops are almost open 24/7 and people barely take a break, Shabbat is actually a good practice to encourage people to take rests.</p>

<p><u>Studying in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem</u></p>

<p>The major teaching language in The Hebrew University of Jerusalem is Hebrew. The university arranged all exchange students to study in Rothberg International School, where most of the courses are taught in English.</p>

<p>I took different courses as an exchange student in the Hebrew University and all of them are about special topics that won’t be covered in Hong Kong: Jewish-Non-Jewish Relations and Rescue During the Holocaust, Religion and Conflict in the Middle East: A Jewish Perspective, Negotiating Middle East Peace, Archaeology in Jerusalem and Colloquial Arabic (Beginners). All professors I met in the Hebrew University are kind and helpful.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog30_05.jpg" width="350" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="image/photo/blog30_06.jpg" width="350" /><br>
<i>(left) My professor in the Archaeology in Jerusalem class. (right) Tomb of King David</i></center></p>

<p>One of the most interesting courses I took is Archaeology in Jerusalem. Half of the lectures in this course were conducted in the form of field trip. We visited historical sites around Jerusalem and learnt about their unique backgrounds. We have been to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Gethsemane, City of David and the Israel Museum.</p>

<p>In the course about the Holocaust, we visited Yad Vashem, an official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. It was a heavy yet inspiring lecture. I now fully understand why we need to avoid genocide from happening again in the future.</p>

<p>Since I had set my foot on the Middle East, I thought learning Arabic would be one best way to learn more about the culture. The language course on Arabic turned out to be the most difficult course for me and to be honest, although it is a beginner-level course, it is not easy at all. Therefore I am particularly proud that I now can greet people with basic Arabic!</p>

<p>Apart from academic support, Rothberg International School organized many different activities to help international students adjust to life in Jerusalem as well as experience the different sides of Israel. I joined two school-organized tours and visited the Negev in Southern Israel and hiked along the Sea of Galilee. I was really glad that I had different opportunities to meet new friends and explore the natural side of Israel at the same time.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog30_07.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>After a long hike, we arrived at the Church of Transfiguration on Mount Tabor. It is believed to be the site where the Transfiguration of Christ took place.</i></center></p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog30_08.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>Abseiling a cliff in the Negev during a school trip</i></center></p>

<p>The school also organized events that allowed us to connect with local people. We were invited to join a Passover Seder dinner with a local Jewish family. The Pesach (or the Passover) is a major Jewish holiday to commemorate Jewish’s liberation by God from slavery in ancient Egypt.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog30_09.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>My friends and I attended a traditional Passover Seder. Bitter herbs were served to remind people of the bitter times in Egypt.</i></center></p>

<p>Israel is only one country in the Middle East region and if I want to know more about this “mysterious” land, I need to see more than just Israel. During the Passover holiday, I went to Jordan for a short trip with two classmates.</p>

<p>One highlight of the trip is visiting one of the New 7 Wonders of the World – Petra, which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is a magnificent rock city in the desert that was carved by the Nabataeans thousands years ago.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog30_10.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>We walked 3 hours under the boiling sun and arrived the highest point of Petra, the High Place of Sacrifice.</i></center></p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog30_11.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>A photo of me with Al Khazneh (The Treasury). It took me 2 hours hike to this spot! What a trip!</i></center></p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog30_12.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>Floating in the Dead Sea – checked!</i></center></p>

<p>The culture and life style in the Middle East are completely different from those in Hong Kong. When I first arrived in Israel, I had a huge cultural shock, which was a result of experiencing huge differences in daily life, including but not limited to different food choices and weather. Compared to those in Hong Kong, food options in Jerusalem are not so diverse and are comparably simple. Although the weather in Israel is always hot and sunny, air-conditioning is seldom used. Looking back right now I’m glad that I have overcame the cultural shock and enjoyed the fruitful and meaningful time in Israel.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog30_13.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>The Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, which is at the core dispute of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</i></center></p>

<p>People in Jerusalem say that everyone comes to the city for a reason. I met people from all around the world, of different races and with various religion beliefs. Through learning the language, culture and history, I understand that the long and complex history contributes to the religious and political conflicts on this holy land. I enjoyed this opportunity to explore the many different sides of this country and I definitely feel grateful that I was given the opportunity and the supports along the way. Exchange in Jerusalem is without doubt one of the best choices I made in my university life.</p>
