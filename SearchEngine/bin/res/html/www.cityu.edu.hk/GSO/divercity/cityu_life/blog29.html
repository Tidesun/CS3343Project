<p>As university students, it’s hard to pinpoint experiences that we are all familiar with. We come from different cultures and backgrounds. We all watch different TV shows and play different games and read different books to procrastinate, instead of doing our assignments. But there is one thing that many CityU students are familiar with, and that is staying in the Student Residence at 22 Cornwall Street.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog29_01.jpg" width="600" /></center></p>

<p>I can still recall the sheer anxiety and the low-key panic that gripped me by the throat the first moment that I learned that I was going to have a roommate for the next three years of my life. It’s really a surreal concept when you think about it. In a lottery-like scheme, you are paired up with a total stranger you don’t know anything about to share your most private space with.</p>

<p>The flooding questions in the back of my mind were pressing: what if we don’t get along? What if it gets really awkward? What if she finds it impossible to cope with my Harry Potter obsession? Frankly, I was terrified. But the anticipation was worse than the real thing, and when I finally met the Roommate with a capital R, all my anxiety went away – it turned out she was even more nervous than I was, and we have become good friends.</p>

<p>But naturally, when you live together with someone, you start to note some of the peculiarities that she or he has. This idea got me thinking: what are some of the oddest experiences fellow students have shared with their roommates? I started the interviews with high expectation, and honestly, they did not disappoint. Here are some of the stories my friends have shared with me.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog29_02.jpg" width="600" /></center></p>

<p>“My roommate’s weird obsession is <strong>locking our doors</strong>. It has happened multiply times before that she accidentally locked me out! I was in the bathroom, and I wanted to go back to the room and then I just found the door locked… She tends to forget that I’m in there. Now we have a sign up on the bathroom door whenever I’m in there, so that I don’t have to bang on the door every time I get stuck.” – Elisa</p>

<p>“My roommate has <strong>crazy sleep habits</strong>. Basically, what happens when he goes to sleep is that he will either <strong>speak Urdu</strong> and talk with a very funny accent in his sleep, or because he watches a lot of anime, he talks Japanese. Yeah, he is <strong>sleep-talking in Japanese</strong>. I’m not sure what he is saying, I don’t understand Japanese, but maybe it’s for the best.” – Archit</p>

<p>“My roommate and I normally don’t talk much, actually. We don’t have any classes together, and we have different friends, so we don’t spend time together outside our room. But it all changed when the <strong>cockroach problem</strong> in our room got out of hand… From the beginning of our first semester of being roommates, my roommate has started keeping a count of all the cockroaches that she has killed, and at one point, it just became a casual topic between us. It’s really weird and funny, but it’s true that the cockroaches brought us together.” – Anonymous</p>

<p> “Last semester, my roommate was an exchange student, and she had the weirdest habit ever. She always <strong>slept naked</strong>, she would just take all her clothes off before going to bed. Yes, <strong>even her underwear</strong>! I found it really odd, and it was quite funny because she always said she was cold when I turned on the AC because of this. This one time I remember that I had a Skype call with my boyfriend and she was actually undressing behind me, I didn’t know what to say. Honestly, it was one of the most absurd experiences that I’ve ever had. I saw things, you know.” – Anonymous</p>

<p>“I don’t even know where to begin. My roommate has many… quirks. First off, he is obsessed with chess and he takes arranging his things in pairs and all that very seriously. In fact, he gathers used bottles and lines them up. It’s sort of a <strong>bottle collection</strong> now, there are just so many. Other than that, what I can recall is that he sometimes stands up from his bed or his chair just to stroll around the room and then he sits back. Oh, and his <strong>girlfriend</strong>! He has long conversation over Skype with his girlfriend, and he doesn’t use headphone, so I always hear them argue a lot. It gets kind of awkward when she starts crying, I feel so bad for him.” – Anonymous</p>

<p>“My roommate is the type of person who <strong>names everything</strong>. I mean everything. Let it be my cactus, our Wi-Fi adaptor, or even the huge cockroaches from our bathroom. Also, she has this gigantic energy. I remember this one time, at the start of this semester, I already got back to the room when she got back to Hong Kong from the semester break. So she got home from a seventeen hours long flight, and instead of going to sleep or taking a shower or packing out, she proceeded to put her luggage in the middle of the room, and get the fairy lights and a large decorative scarf she got from home, and went ahead to tape those on the wall to <strong>decorate</strong> it. Priorities.” – Anna</p>

<p>“Oh, where do I start? I think the oddest thing about my roommate is her absolute obsession with her <strong>guitar</strong>. She plays it for so long, even late at night, and honestly she is just mad about her guitar. I feel like they have this intimate relationship that I feel like I’m disturbing sometimes! But it’s not that surprising because this is only one weird attribute of hers. To tell you the truth, she is a junkie for <strong>internet memes</strong> and she has exactly the meme-kind of sense of humour, so even around 2:00 am a lot of times I hear her laughing, looking at her memes.” – Anonymous</p>

<p>“Basically, my roommate is a dedicated fan of <strong>Korean dramas</strong>. Many times when I look over to her desk, I see her watching them. It’s pretty entertaining, because many times she is rolling around in her bed because of them. Also, she loves wrapping herself in her blanket like a taco and looking out of the window, just <strong>watching</strong> the people walking downstairs, much <strong>like a grandma</strong>. Apart from these weird quirks, I have never met anyone who is more obsessed with <strong>chicken nuggets</strong> and the <strong>McChicken burger</strong> than her, and <strong>honey</strong>… oh, the amount of honey that she consumes… it’s crazy.” – My weird roommate story</p>
