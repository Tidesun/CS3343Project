<p>From February 26th to the 27th, CityU students and their fellows from other local universities had the pleasure to participate in the first-ever CityU hackathon event – CityHack 2018. Organised by CityU students, CityHack 2018 was to bring together students from various backgrounds to work together over the span of 2 days to create solutions for a real-life problem. Ten teams took part in the challenge to create a program of their own design. “Our aim is to break away from conventional education to create a ‘hack’ through collaborative effort”, said the organizing team of the event. There was also a special treat of pizza offered to all participants. It was a very exciting two-day event where many of the ideas emerged within hours. All the teams worked very hard and each group was unique in their own way.</p>

<i>Student Participants and Judges of CityHack 2018</i></center></p>

<p>Having the opportunity to interview the teams, we presented them with some questions:</p>

<p><strong><i>“Where were you from?”</i></strong></p>

<p>Each of the groups not only consisted of students from Hong Kong but also from many different regions including Hungry, India, Mainland China, Pakistan, South Africa, and Taiwan.</p>

<p><strong><i>“Did you need to know coding in order to participate?”</i></strong></p>

<p>Coding was not a compulsory requirement as within a team we had different roles such as technical manager, sales manager, marketing manager, etc. The organizing committee tried their best to allocate people to teams based on their skill sets. Many participants were from science majors such as computer science and electrical engineering, and some were from business majors. Those who studied computer science said although they learned much about coding through taking courses, practicing is important. Coding is a skill that needs a lot of practices and many students realized that their skills improve over time through practicing. Like one of the participants said that he started learning the basic components of coding in secondary school and has been joining many coding competitions, as well as hackathons to improve his coding skills.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog43_04.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>One of the Teams, “Debugging is life”</i></center></p>

<p><strong><i>“How are you and your team feeling about this event?”</i></strong></p>

<p>When asked about their feelings of the competition, all students responded with positivity. Team members found that the Hackathon offered an excellent opportunity for them to try their hand at practicing their coding skills, while others found this a great way to explore their ideas and create something new. Yet the comradeship was present in each group who worked towards their project goal. Some expressed that this event, being a competition, offered a nice environment for the groups to learn and practice teamwork skills. </p>

<p><strong><i>“Have you encountered any problem while working with your group? How did you overcome the problem?”</i></strong></p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges present in the competition was creating an idea. But once a team was able to come up with a particular idea that everyone agrees to work on together, other problems could be solved quite easily. Some minor problems did happen, but those problems can be overcome easily. </p>

<i>Judges: [From Left to Right] Dr. Daniel Howe (School of Creative Media), Dr. Alexandar Djordjevich (College of Science and Engineering), Ms. Dorothy Suen (Microsoft), Mr. Eric Fan (UDomain)</i></center></p>

<p>This year, the organizers invited faculty members and industry professionals to be the judges. The popularity of the project idea and the overall usefulness of the concept determined which team stood out from the rest. The winners of most popular idea and second runners-up went to Anchit Som for their idea to transcribe lessons into notes so that students may use it for further study later on. The 1st runners-up went to Mamosound for their design on creating a platform that will help university students organize events on campus as well as keeping track of expenditure through an online coin system. The champions of this first ever CityU hackathon went to team Codiva. They won the contest by designing a platform that will help CityU students keep track of open areas on the campus so that students can locate places to study and do group discussion easily. The secret to establishing such a platform is an algorithm that would monitor how many people are in the rooms and whether some rooms are vacant.</p>

<p>None of this would have been possible without the help from the IT team at HSBC Prosperity Hall (Hall 2) who created and founded this event. Getting the chance to sit down and speak to them, we had the chance to see what it took to plan the events.</p>

<p><strong><i>“How did your team form this event?”</i></strong></p>

<p>Before holding this event, the organizing team had held various coding workshops for students to learn and explore latest technologies. They started to prepare for this event more than half a year ago and were inspired by other universities around the world having hackathons already. The team asked themselves, “Why doesn’t CityU have this event?” They formed this event by having many meeting and discussions to find ideas on how to make a successful hackathon and to do the preparation.</p>

<i>The Creators of CityHack: IT Team of HSBC Prosperity Hall (Hall 2) </i></center></p>

<p><strong><i>“What were the challenges to you while creating this event?”</i></strong></p>

<p>One of the challenges that the organizing team faced was how to maintain and gain interest for this event, especially given the fact that this was an event created for the first time at CityU. Another challenge was to get people who didn’t know about coding interested, as many find it difficult to learn. Yet by having the coding workshops, the organizers found a good solution for getting students interested in learning more about the subject and participating in the event.</p>

<p>Through hours of planning and finding solutions to obstacles of creating and promoting the event, students on the organizing team successfully brought the first student-organized hackathon to CityU campus.</p>

<p>Many of those participated in CityHack 2018 already look forward to the next hackathon at CityU. Let’s all join together next year and create something together, shall we?</p>
