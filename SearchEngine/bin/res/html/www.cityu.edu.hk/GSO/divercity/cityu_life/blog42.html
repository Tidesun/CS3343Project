<p>This is already my third year in University, and let me tell you something that scares me the most: job applications. I would rather drown myself in academics and extra-curricular activities rather than facing the bleak reality of having to start adulting and applying for jobs.</p>

<p>As much as I don’t like to admit it, Finance might not be the best major for me. Why did I apply for it in the first place then? There were a lot of reasons. Mainly, having parents that still hold conservative values. For some parents, children going for a major that does not coincide with their interest or with their line of job might not appeal to them as much. My parents will be pleased to see me becoming an entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Second, peer pressure. In my second last year of high school, we had to fill a piece of paper stating down the major we wanted to take in college. A lot of my friends wrote fancy majors, like biomedical engineering, computer science or applied mathematics. We had the GCE system in our high school and students had the option to choose whatever subjects they wanted to take for their GCE A-levels. Having a similar mindset to the parents, many teachers paid most of their attention to the business and science stream students while the art, humanities and sociology students get left out because my school didn’t have the same amount of resources for them. As a result, there was an impression that choosing to go to art school meant being greeted by a sceptical, <i>“But why?”</i>, and that selecting subjects apart from science or business was undesirable.</p>


<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog42_01.jpg" width="650" /></center></p>

<p>To be completely honest here, although there were courses I found more interesting than others in Finance, I never got excited to go to class. I studied because it was my responsibility as a student. As years passed, I have seen friends applying for banking and consultant jobs and hear the names of the big 4 companies pop out frequently in conversations. Hearing my peers and seniors got internships or job offers in business-related fields is nothing new to me.</p>

<p>As graduation comes looming, the pressure of applying for an internship that leads to my post-graduation employment increases. Even though I know I should start applying, I secretly dread it. I’ve been told many times that going to interviews is essentially like selling yourself. You need to show what you can offer and how you can be of value to the company. Every time I think of it, I come to a dead end. <i>What can I offer?</i> I didn’t know how to differentiate myself, and this might be because of the lack of experience or the lack of interest in the industry. I questioned myself a lot and only applied for very few jobs in the end.</p>

<p>During the my sophomore year, I called my mom to tell her my worries and asked if I should probably switch major. <i>“Don’t worry about it. You’re in your second year. Your courses might be really hard, and so you feel like running away from it,”</i> she answered. By that advice, I swallowed all desire to switch major.</p>

<p>Luckily, I saw the light for a turn. Last summer, I went to Thailand as a volunteer to be an English teacher in the rural areas. My whole Thailand experience was entirely out of expectations and it became one of my fondest life memories. I kept a journal of the trip and wrote down a lot of the memories I had in Thailand. I ended up sending my Thailand entry as an application for a writer position with ResLink, a publication by Student Residence Office. That was my first job that I got accepted, and I was beaming because writing has always been a way for me to express myself and my emotions. Although at that point, most of the content was not intended for public consumption, it was exciting that I could write for more than just myself.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog42_02.jpg" width="650" /></center></p>

<p>From that first job, I got accepted to other writing assignments and even landed on a digital marketing internship in Australia. It took a while for me to realise that I might not be good at Finance, and I might not be the best writer too, but I found a deep interest in digital marketing and how social media can help leverage businesses. I might only have applied less than 10% of the knowledge that I gained in the past years of university life in this marketing internship, and even though I still have very little knowledge about digital marketing,  I have decided to give it a try in this industry. It’s scary and I do not know how it would turn out, but it’s worth a shot.</p>

<p>I came to college not knowing what to expect. It’s hard to ask questions when you don’t even know what you’re facing! But by time, I also learnt to just go with the flow—<strong>learn from my mistakes and adapt to whatever challenges I’m facing at the moment</strong>. Some people may have it more put together than I do. A lot of others may have a vague plan in mind. But if you keep trying, bit by bit, you will find what you are good at and interested in through out-of-classroom experience! At the end of the day, instead of being envious of other’s achievements, <strong>I have learnt and decided to just focus on me and myself</strong>.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog42_03.jpg" width="650" /></center></p>

<p>We feel fear when faced with the unknown, but it is part of being alive, something we all share. I can’t be sure that my future career will be bright and smooth sailing, but who can? <strong>I’d like to think of everything as a learning process and I’m still learning so much about myself, about what I like and don’t like, and what I’m going to do in the future</strong>. I might land a Finance job in the future and who knows, I might enjoy myself doing Finance related work at certain point in my life. Even if eventually I don’t, it’s all a learning process and never a waste of time.</p>

<p>My future career doesn’t have to be related to my major, and I’m okay with that. <strong>Yes, I have been through doubt and struggles, but there is also sense of achievement and inspiration along the way</strong>. For those of you who have doubts about the major you are studying and those of you who are uncertain about what job you want to do, I certainly hope that some of you can relate to this personal struggle of mine and know that you’re not alone. </p>

<p>Lastly, quoting from business mogul Gary Vee, “Every second you spend thinking about what someone else has, it is taking away from time that you can create something for yourself. Spend that energy on your visions and execute it!” </p>
