<p><strong>A Long Journey Away from Home</strong></p>

<p>What does it mean to be a Singaporean who has not traveled a lot (yea, that’s me)? It means that you could see or feel the freezing winter air, the autumn leaves that fall on your lap, and the sweet-smelling spring only in your imagination. </p>

<p>It’s January. After a 4-hour flight (from Singapore), I made it to Hong Kong.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog31_03.jpg" width="650" /></center></p>

<p>“Oh my God, how cold is it going to be? I can’t wait to step out of the airport and feel it for myself!” I pulled out my newly purchased denim jacket excitedly, ready to brave the cold wind outside.</p>

<p>It actually wasn’t my first time here. It was the third time I have landed on the “Asia’s World City”, but this time it felt different from before. It was the beginning of my 5-month stay in a different country — the longest stay away from home I ever had. This time, I had to take care of myself and learn to live in a new environment.</p>

<p>Space in the student residence was limited so for all students, on-campus accommodation was not guaranteed. “I GOT A PLACE IN THE STUDENT RESIDENCE!” Imagine my excitement (followed by relief) when I received the email from CityU saying that I had gotten a place in the student residence. After all, the thought of possibly having no shelter over my head was nerve-wracking. With accommodation secured, it felt like I had made it to the first check point of this long journey.</p>

<p>Together with 2 other friends, we made our way from the airport to our Airbnb apartment at Sham Shui Po for the first night because we couldn’t check into student residence yet. Each of us had a 30kg luggage to carry to our apartment on the third level without the help of an elevator. After half an hour (or more) of battle with our baggage and the narrow staircase, we finally made it to our apartment!</p>

<p>The Airbnb was a subdivided unit (also known as 劏房 or tong1 fong4) and that could only mean one thing — small. This wasn’t my first time in Hong Kong and I had prepared myself for a really small apartment considering the budget I had. What was slightly out of expectation was that the apartment was actually very well-furnished albeit its size: there were a bed which could fit a friend and myself, a couch, a television, a drawer, and even a kitchenette with a refrigerator and a washing machine!</p>

<p>The day ended with a scrumptious dinner at Tim Ho Wan. After a night of rest, we were ready to move our baggage down three floors again.</p>

<p><strong>The Perks of Living on Campus</strong></p>

<p>Upon arrival at the hall, we were greeted by a friendly security guard at the lobby. We later met many other security guards and they were all extremely welcoming and friendly. (We would later also come to realize that one of the hardest things about checking out of hall at the end of semester was having to bid farewell to these friendly guardian angels.)</p>

<p>We spent the first day cleaning the place that we would call home for the next five months with a lot of elbow grease.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog31_01.jpg" width="600" /><br><i>The Million-Dollar View from My Room at CityU</i></center></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Though students living off-campus might be able to get some more experiences from outside the university and there was a group of hosts hired by the Off-campus Peer Support Accommodation programme serving as the support network and organizing events and activities. In my stay at the student residence, I came to realize there were a few perks of living there:</p>

<ol>
<li>You get to walk to school! (This means you get to sleep in a little longer! :D)</li>
<li>It’s affordable! (Rental in Hong Kong can get quite pricey.)</li>
<li>Spatially speaking, it’s luxurious! (You know how small houses are in Hong Kong. I lived in a 3-person room though and different room types come in different sizes.)</li>
<li>It’s easy to meet new friends who are studying at City University!</li>
<li>You get to join activities such as Taiwanese Night, Indonesian Night etc. (These cultural events are enjoyable and fun. Bonus: New friends!)</li>
<li>If you’re lucky enough, you could get a room that gives you a million-dollar view! (I fell in love at first sight.)</li>
<li>You get to hit the gym without having to pay for any membership fees! (Gotta work your butt off (literally) to burn off those curry fish balls and egg tarts and egg waffles and stinky tofu and siew mai...enough said.)</li>
<li>Oh... Did I mention you get to walk to school?</li>
</ol>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog31_02.jpg" width="300" /><br><i>The Familiar Route Back to Student Residence</i></center></p>

<p><strong>Find Your Way, Meet New People, Fill Your Belly and Enjoy</strong></p>

<p>Looking back at what I experienced at CityU, if I were to advise those who are coming to CityU for exchange, these would be what I would like to share:</p>

<p><u>Finding your way around in school</u></p>

<p>First I have to say that it’s absolutely hard for anyone to get lost in the CityU campus. I’d imagine that even someone with a poor sense of direction would be able to locate his classroom. There are literally just 3 main academic buildings — AC1, AC2, and AC3. Furthermore, AC1 (which I had majority of my classes at) is divided into different color zones, which makes navigation even easier. Even in unlikely cases where you do get lost, never hesitate to approach a fellow student or a staff to ask more directions. They will be more than happy to help you find your way. If you’re a non-local student who doesn’t speak Cantonese like myself, this could be your chance to learn and practice your Cantonese, so grab it!</p>

<p><u>Meeting new people in class</u></p>

<p>I still remember vividly the first lecture that I attended in CityU. It was a linguistics class and I was all alone. As I walked into the lecture theatre I did a quick scan of the seats and I spotted a girl who was sitting alone. I mustered up enough courage to walk towards her. “Hi, may I take this seat?” I asked, pointing at the seat beside hers. She gladly welcomed me to the seat and after I settled down, I began introducing myself and she reciprocated with a self-introduction too. That is how I made my first friend in the campus! Therefore, do not be shy and take the initiative to talk to others. There is nothing to lose, and you may even be in for a surprise!</p>

<p><u>Filling your belly in school</u></p>

<p>My favorite place to go to for lunch was definitely City Express (because of the roast duck rice there), which is conveniently located at AC1. That is the place to go if you are hungry. You will get your food in no time at all. Trust me, it’s more efficient than the McDonald’s at Festival Walk. There are also many seats available, which means it’s not difficult to find a seat at all!</p>

<p>Be it the canteen at AC1, AC2, OR AC3, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the canteens at CityU change up their menus, over the months and sometimes even over a day where there are breakfast, lunch and teatime menus etc. This does not happen back in my home university in Singapore. (You know, things could get a little boring in college canteens). That being said, it is possible that the food that you fall in love with could be gone the next day, so eat more of it while it’s still on the menu (just kidding, you should explore other food options!)</p>

<p><strong>Home Sweet Home</strong></p>

<p>This article is titled “Same but different” because being an exchange student felt different from being a tourist in Hong Kong. I felt a greater sense of belonging in the former self, although the place was the same. What I have shared here is not everything there is to my life as an exchange student in Hong Kong. Nonetheless these are precious memories that are etched in my mind and will stay with me for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>If you are an exchange student reading this, you know that it is not just an academic exchange and more so of a cultural exchange. To do so you will have to step out of the school and explore this mesmerizing city, and I shall leave that guidance to Google. </p>

<p>“Where has the time gone?” My friends and I lamented. Five months passed in the blink of an eye and it was time to return home. </p>

<p>My journey ended but the memories will stay a lifetime.</p>
