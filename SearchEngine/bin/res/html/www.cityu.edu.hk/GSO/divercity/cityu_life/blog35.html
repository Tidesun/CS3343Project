<p>Most of the CityU students would know that period of time when various societies stand by the podium of Yeung Kin Man Academic Building, chanting their society cheers, trying to get people to vote for them as the next committee members of different societies. We also see how these organizations dedicate their time and effort to serve their society members, through numerous events and activities.</p>

<p>University life is more than just study. Apart from joining societies, in fact there are many different opportunities for university students to take up a leadership position. We believe that youths are the new power generation, and the leaders of tomorrow. Hence, DiverCity writers got the chance to get up close and personal to five student leaders in our university community. They are the go-getters and the drivers of what makes our university so vibrant and eventful.</p>

<p><strong>What is your responsibility as a resident tutor?</strong></p>

<p>The Hall 1 Residence Tutor Team aims to cultivate the culture and community of the hall, acting as the steward for hall administration as well. I have been a resident tutor for 3 months from the start of academic year 2017/18.</p>

<p><strong>Have you faced challenges in which you struggled but eventually succeeded? Can you share with us one example?</strong></p>

<p>It's been a short run, and I wouldn't say that I've succeeded. The biggest challenge for me is perhaps diversity. I just came across somebody who told me that sometimes we like to "see" diversity, but not so much to "listen" to diversity. Here in Hall 1, we have hundreds of people coming from different countries, cultures, ethnicities, and even as simple as different lifestyles. What I have seen so far is that it seems to be impossible to get everyone on the same page, which is never happening, but I guess at least what we should do is to try to get everyone on the same page by listening to each other. In other words, we might have the differences in language, sleeping time, coursework, and other stuff like that, but at the end of the day, we should still spare some time to gather and talk with our neighbours. I won't say that I've succeeded, but I guess I'm making that small steps on the floor, and also towards hall-wide events.</p>

<p><strong>How is the development of your organisation currently and how do you see your team going forward in the future?</strong></p>

<p>First of all, we're still in a period of transition. But it's a good one-- heading in the right direction. I personally see the hall management team getting a lot more diverse in the future, representing the multicultural residents that it has. But obviously this is subject to the agreement from the rest of my team, and perhaps from the entire resident body. To conduct periodic or an annual review of the events and activities that we've organized is also an important part in the coming years. I've also seen a lot more activities being initiated by the residents, for example, events like the International Fridays or TGIF (i.e. “Thank God It’s Friday”), as we call it, and also the Hall Energy Team.</p>

<p><strong>You are the founder of TedXCityUHongKong. Can you tell me what TedX is?</strong></p>

<p>TedXCityUHongKong is an organization that aims at contributing to the bigger movement of “ideas worth spreading”, as initiated by TED. It is a student team composed purely of undergraduate students of CityU, with the common goal of providing a better idea sharing and co-learning platform. We aim to celebrate humanity and share knowledge to our community. My role as the founder of TedXCityUHK started in May 2016 and has yet to end.</p>

<p><strong>What made you interested in taking up a leadership position?</strong></p>

<p>I think not a lot of university students nowadays want to take up a major leadership role and build something that reinforces a purpose and a vision. Personally, I found this quite frustrating and decided to take up the position myself. I believe that with proper mindset and action, we can achieve something bigger than ourselves. I want to inspire others.</p>

<p><strong>How do you see your team going forward in the future?</strong></p>

<p>I want to make ideas known through the world that’s why I established TedXCityU. In addition to sharing ideas, I want to create a sense of belonging in the TedX community and our community members would be able to nurture each other’s dream and passion. My team and I aspire to create an environment where we can influence lives for the better, and where different personalities can work towards the same goal. It’s a learning space for everyone, and I want my team to be comfortable and do things for the community with the vision and mission to bring value to the team, not solely out of responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about the International Society?</strong></p>

<p>Our mission is to promote internationalisation and integration. When we talk about integration, it is not just about bridging between non-locals and locals. I believe integration starts within the non-local community itself. And I've been serving as President of the International Society (ISOC) of CityU for 11 months now.</p>

<p><strong>Are you able to balance society work with your academics? If yes, how?</strong></p>

<p>Before I became elected as the president of the ISOC Committee, I used to think that organization work would significantly affect my study. I still took the risk, however, because I see the value in helping other international students. After all the time and dedication given to ISOC, I now have a new viewpoint regarding time management. Because academic work and ISOC take up most of my time, I have less time to do unproductive things because I have to plan my schedule wisely. At the end of the day it all works out.</p>

<p><strong>In your experience, what are the challenges faced by your members and how did you address these problems?</strong></p>

<p>ISOC regularly hold events to promote integration amongst non-local students. What people don’t realise is that to make an event a success, a lot of preparation is involved and it is very time-consuming to plan and prepare. Therefore, time management is crucial! Managing the team is also very important, and knowing when to delegate effectively. For example, sometimes some of our committee members are occupied with other affairs and cannot take part in preparations or the event itself, so we make sure to allocate them to a different task that they can help instead, without having to compromise their other priorities. Making sure everyone can fill out each other’s gaps is very important to keep the team solid.</p>

</tr></table></p>

<p><strong>What does the CSSAUG do?</strong></p>

<p>CSSAUG mainly serves mainland undergraduate students at CityU, but it also aims to build a bridge between mainland students and students from other parts of the world. The target is to let mainland students be more involved in the CityU community and university life through various events and providing welfares to the students. I have been serving my team and the community for a total of 1 year. Adding the 2 months of preparation for the election, it’s a total of 14 months’ service.</p>

<p><strong>Why did you choose this position? What made you interested in it?</strong></p>

<p>Frankly speaking, I consider the leadership position as an honour as well as a significant part of my university life. By joining the society, I had an opportunity to achieve my self-value. CSSAUG’s value is also one of the reasons why I joined in the first place. In our organisation, the word “devotion” is always mentioned. You have to devote yourself to work and bring benefits to the mainland students’ community. There is a large population of mainland students in our university. For these students, they come from the Mainland and most of them had a boring life in senior high school. Therefore, they may not be able to fit in the university life here easily, even without considering other unique local features like the English teaching environment, the different cultures and living habits. Our society aims to provide a better environment for these students to gradually get themselves used to the life here, so a lot of activities are organized to build a bridge to help them connect with each other.</p>

<p><strong>Have you faced any challenges in these 14 months of service?</strong></p>

<p>Of course. Admittedly, our team met some challenges that we struggled and eventually failed. Yet there are also success cases. What I want to emphasize is, if you decide to take up a position, the first thing you need to prepare yourself for is failure. I believe that if you put all your effort to solve a problem, there is a great chance that you will succeed eventually. This is the kind of mentality that you should always have. Take our annual Carnival event as an example, at that time, we couldn’t find a venue large enough on campus because the Wei Hing Theatre was closed down. We even planned to hold the event outside of school. But event venues in Kowloon Tong are very expensive so we had to consider elsewhere. After a lot of investigation, we found it would be an unwise decision because people would not bother to go to a place so distant. After rounds of negotiations with the Dean of Students and other parties involved, we managed to find one suitable place with his help and ran the even smoothly.</p>

<p><strong>What is the CityU Choir?</strong></p>

<p>CityU Choir is a platform for students, alumni and staff who are music lovers to sing together and improve their choral skills. Here they can sing together, put together performances, meet new friends with similar interests and learn more about chorus and music. It aims to create music that can bring happiness to both its members and the audience. I have been serving this committee for 4 months as the President, but I’ve been with the CityU Choir for 3 years now, and I was the External Vice President last year.</p>

<p><strong>What made you interested in taking up this position?</strong></p>

<p>Personally speaking, I like chorus very much. To me, CityU Choir feels like a big family. My first year in the Choir as an ordinary member was a great experience, so I wanted to stay and learn to involve more in its administration. Now, it’s my third year with the Choir, and I’m eager to contribute and give back as much as I could. I hope to bring new things into this big family. If these changes can bring more happiness and generate greater interests among both our old and new members, I would be thrilled to spare more effort to contribute. That’s why I decided to try and challenge myself to take up the position of President. Meanwhile, I hope it can enrich my experience and enhance my different capabilities through taking up this challenging role.</p>

<p><strong>What are your tips to manage both study and work with the Choir?</strong></p>

<p>For me, interest always comes first. I don’t mind devoting my time and effort to my interests and I have prepared myself for challenges before I assume this role, that’s why I am not scared of difficulties. As a year-3 student, I’m quite busy with a wide range of tasks. I maintain a schedule and take note of things to help myself keep a track of everything I need to do and prioritize my tasks. The key is to plan and prioritize. </p>
