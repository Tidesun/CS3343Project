<p>In only three years, <i>Indonesian Night</i>, a cultural event sponsored by the University’s <a href="http://www.cityu.edu.hk/gso/sip.htm" target="_blank">Student Initiated Projects</a> has evolved into a signature event to celebrate authentic Indonesian cultures with performances, music, food, and traditional handicrafts. Hosted by Indonesian student community, this year’s event was held on February 7th, revolving performances and traditions of the island of gods - Devata, which is also commonly known as Bali in Indonesia.</p>

<p>The evening began with the song “Indonesia Pusaka,” followed by a traditional Balinese dance, <i>Tari Pendet</i>.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog41_01.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>Indonesian students performing Tari Pendet, a Balinese dance often performed in temples or theaters by young women as a prelude to a ceremony or dance.</i></center></p>

<p>The dim lighting in the venue immersed the audience in the serenity of Bali, one of the most famous islands of Indonesia. Even though the room was packed with people, the vibe was calming and surreal.</p>

<p>It reminded me of the time when the team leader of the organizers, Yiwann Tjandra Budajawan, described what the team wished to achieve through Indonesian Night 2018.</p>

<p><strong><i>“We want to bring the powerful and yet calming vibe of Bali to CityU, showing a different side of Indonesia to other people of different cultural backgrounds.”</i></strong></p>

<p>From the graceful dance moves and the melodious singing of the Indonesian students to the Indonesian snacks prepared for each guest, everything was well prepared down to the smallest detail. The costumes and the venue decorations clearly reflected the efforts of the organizing team. The stage was continuously filled with enthusiastic performers who brought Indonesian arts and culture to life. There is no doubt that these students are proud of their heritage and are determined to show everyone the beauty of their country.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog41_02.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>Students performing Tari Gopala, a traditional Balinese dance by males.</i></center></p>

<p>The venue was filled with laughter and amazement during one of the event’s highlights: the theatrical drama. Not only did the theater team beautifully showcase the story of Ramayana through the drama, they brought joy to the visitors with unexpected punchlines between acts. The whole room was amused when one of the actors asked an audience member whether he had seen another character in the drama!</p>

<p>The well-made props used in the drama added even more vibrant colors to the show. If one paid close attention to what was happening backstage during the drama, it was easy to see the organizers giving one another hand gestures to signal the changing of the lights. The amount of coordination needed for the drama to be a success required great teamwork!</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog41_03.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>Students adapted Ramayana, an ancient Indian epic poem about the divine prince Rama rescuing his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana, and transformed Multifunction Hall A at the Student Residence into a theater.</i></center></p>

<p><strong><i>“I can see that all the people involved in the drama wanted to make the best possible show, and I am really proud of them!”</i></strong> said Dewi Suroto, one of the Theatre Managers, when asked how she felt watching the drama after months of tough practices. The difficulties faced by the actors and actresses in polishing their performances were a challenge, and the job of planning the lighting and sound effects was another!</p>

<p>Although none of the students were professional actors, they all brought their best when facing challenges. Everyone who helped put the show together knows that their efforts were not wasted. Just by how the audience groaned in frustration every time the drama ended between acts for breaks, it was obvious that the guests enjoyed the combination of a traditional tale with occasional modern comedic twists.</p>

<p>The passion of the organizers and helpers is doubtless one important reason for the event’s great success. Their pride in their culture has encouraged them to put together an amazing night for the students of CityU.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog41_04.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>Students from all backgrounds enjoyed the performances put together by the Indonesian students. Although the production was not perfect, everyone could see the efforts made by the student organizers.</i></center></p>

<p>Throughout the event, I spoke with many people to learn more about their feelings regarding the event.</p>

<p><strong><i>“The food was amazing, as always! I had been looking forward to Indonesian Night and I was so excited.”</i></strong> Muskaan Gandhi, a second-year student from India, also attended Indonesian Night last year and returned with uncontainable excitement. Not only did she love the food and the performances, she found it amazing how much effort was made for every part of the event. <i>“It’s really nice to see the Indonesians’ great pride towards their roots, and the effort they put into Indonesian Night every year is remarkable.”</i></p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog41_05.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>A variety of snacks and dishes were served to bring Indonesian flavors to the table for guests, including dishes such as rendang (a spicy meat dish), chili egg, marinated chicken, and fried banana.</i></center></p>

<p>In addition to the food, which was loved by everyone, the organizing team’s enthusiasm and evident love for their homeland were frequently mentioned.</p>

<p><strong><i>“We hope all the guests enjoyed the night as much as we did,”</i></strong> said Andrea Sunanda, one of the chief organizers of the event, after Indonesian Night 2018. Needless to say, the visitors had their share of fun throughout the night! She admitted that the preparations for the event were tough at times. There was a lot to be done, and responsibilities come with conflicts among the team members, but Andrea liked the idea of coming up with plans with the rest of the organizing team because they got to laugh at some of the ridiculous things that people thought of!</p>

<p>Through thick and thin, the event has brought the Indonesian community even closer than ever. Seeing the success of the event, Andrea felt even more proud to be a part of the Indonesian family of CityU.</p>

<i>One of the event MCs, Megan Pratana, and one of the student organizers, Andrea Sunanda, enjoying the event with other students.</i></center></p>

<p><strong><i>“To be honest, after a successful Indonesian Night in 2017, we have a certain sense of pressure to do even better this year.”</i></strong> Maria Glenda Octavienna, one of the dancers, talked about the high expectations for this year’s event. The organizing team wanted to bring the audience something even more amazing that could make this year’s Indonesian Night better than that of 2017.</p>

<p><strong><i>“We were aware that it was not easy or even impossible, we could say, to repeat the same success 2 years in a row.”</i></strong> The Project Leader, Yiwann, did not try to hide the pressure the organizing team had on their shoulders. It is never easy to create an event as big as Indonesian Night, for which many people must be involved to turn ideas into reality.</p>

<p>Since October 2017, the various units of the organizing team had been working hard towards the same goal: to allow their guests to feel the beauty of Bali. Although everyone came from the same country and spoke the same language, communication proved to be a challenge. Through cooperation and commitment, the team pulled through, and the event reflects well their most sincere efforts.</p>

<p><strong><i>“I have seen a lot of happy faces throughout the event, and that made me happy,”</i></strong> said Yiwann.</p>

<p><center><img src="image/photo/blog41_07.jpg" width="650" /><br>
<i>Yiwann Tjandra Budajawan, a Chemistry major at CityU from Indonesia, is the team leader for this year’s Indonesian Night.</i></center></p>

<p><strong><i>“We are thankful to be given an opportunity to show how beautiful our home is and a chance for CityU’s Indonesian community to unite as one in creating such an amazing night,”</i></strong> said Yiwann. It was a rewarding roller coaster ride for the organizing team, and the event will remain as a most worthwhile experience, especially for those who made great efforts to make it possible.</p>

<p>Let’s meet this inspiring community once again in 2019, shall we?</p>
