						<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Professor Zuankai Wang</strong>, <strong>Dr Yajing Shen</strong>, PhD students <strong>Haojian Lu</strong> and <strong>Yuanyuan Yang</strong> (BME), research associate <strong>Dr Mei Zhang</strong> (MNE), and their collaborators have developed a novel tiny, soft robot with caterpillar-like legs capable of carrying heavy loads and adaptable to adverse environments.  The mini delivery-robot could pave the way for medical technology advances, such as drug delivery in the human body.  The highly agile milli-robot is able to leap over 10 times its leg length. Thanks to its multi-leg design, which helps reduce friction significantly, the robot can move efficiently inside surfaces in the body lined with, or entirely immersed in, body fluids, such as blood or mucus.  Laboratory tests show that it can carry a load 100 times its own weight, which is comparable to a human easily lifting a 26-seat minibus.  The aim of the research team in the next two to three years is to create a biodegradable robot that will decompose naturally after completing its drug delivery mission.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">The research findings have been published in the latest issue of the scientific journal Nature Communications in a paper titled “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06491-9">A Bio-inspired Multilegged Soft Millirobot that Functions in Both Dry and Wet Conditions</a>”.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Professor Dong Sun</strong>'s team, including <strong>Dr. Junyang Li</strong>, <strong>Dr. Xiaojian Li</strong>, <strong>Mr. Tao Luo</strong>, <strong>Dr. Shuxun Chen</strong>, <strong>Mr. Dongfang Li</strong> and <strong>Dr. Ran Wang</strong>, and collaborators from the Department of Biomedical Sciences, including Professor Shuk-han Cheng and Dr. Jianbo Yue, have developed the world’s first magnetic 3D-printed microscopic robot that can carry cells to precise locations in live animals. The invention could revolutionise cell-based therapy, regenerative medicine and more precise treatment for diseases such as cancer, which is a huge leap for the emerging industry of cell surgery robotics. It is expected that clinical trials can begin over the next five years.  The paper titled "<a href="http://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/3/19/eaat8829">Development of a magnetic microrobot for carrying and delivering targeted cells</a>" has recently been published in <i>Science Robotics</i>. Professor Sun also pointed out that the research is a perfect example of interdisciplinary collaborations at CityU.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Dr. Yang Lu</strong>’s research team, including <strong>Mr. Amit Banerjee</strong> and <strong>Dr. Hongti Zhang</strong> under his supervision, has discovered that diamonds at nanoscale can undergo ultralarge, fully reversible elastic deformation. The research team demonstrated that when diamond was downsized to nearly 100 nanometres in diameter, which is about one six-hundredth of the size of human hair, up to around 9% of tensile elastic strain was recorded for single crystalline samples. The findings could have a profound impact on the nanotechnology and biomedical fields, and even quantum information technologies. This groundbreaking discovery was recently published in the prestigious journal Science under the title “Ultralarge elastic deformation of nanoscale diamond”.</p>

The interdisciplinary work with students from other departments had won the Silver Award in the “JOS Innovative IT Project Awards 2015-2016”, with the actual wheelchair being developed recently using the cash prize received from the award.  Mr. Lam intended to establish cooperation with non-profit organizations for the production of the wheelchair for use by the physically disabled.</p>

S. Lee from the Department of Physics and Materials Science, and other collaborators from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of California, Los Angeles; Xiamen University; and IBM Research Centre.  The recent research led by Dr. Lu has shown that silicon nanowires can be stretched above 10% elastic strain, several times higher than that of previous findings.  A few samples even reached 16%, very close to their theoretical elastic limit.  This groundbreaking discovery will likely bring about revolutionary changes to flexible electronics and medical equipment for the well-being of society.</p>

						<p style="text-align: justify">Dr. Lu and his team have been recently awarded about HK$700,000 from the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong for conducting further research on “Elastic Strain Engineering” of the nanosized silicon.

With an aim to reduce industrial accidents, different types of sensors such as accelerometers and contact sensors have been used to monitor whether the worker has worn the safety hardness correctly.  In addition, wireless technology such as RFID, wifi and Zigbee were being investigated to develop a local positioning system for locating the worker locations in construction sites.  This local position system would help to monitor the movement of workers in the construction site and to ensure that the workers are working at the designated locations.</p>

An APT can be used to analyse nanoscale particles as small as 0.3 to 0.5 nanometres through 3D imaging technology. It allows materials scientists to know precisely the size, shape, composition, and structure of particles.

						<p style="text-align: justify">
						A team of students from the CityU Master of Science in Advanced Technology Management (MSATM) Programme were awarded a second place prize in ABB’s 2<sup>nd</sup> University Innovation Contest.  According to ABB, “Nearly 2,000 students from 287 universities signed up for the contest, presenting 132 submissions in total. It was the first time for college students from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau to be invited to participate in the contest. <strong>The team from the City University of Hong Kong eventually made it to the finals and won the second prize. The innovative concepts and advanced thinking embodied in their designs were highly applauded by the contest review panels.</strong>”</p>
						
						<p style="text-align: justify">
						The CityU team of <strong>Ms. ZHENG Hanzhuo</strong> and <strong>Ms. CHEN Xiaoyin</strong>, both 2013 MSATM graduates, presented a project titled “Magnetic Pipe and its Smartphone App (磁”管道及其手机应用)”  as their solution to ABB’s contest theme of “Innovation Powers the Future” under the subtopic of industrial applications of smartphones. Mentored by faculty (<strong>Dr. John Mai</strong> and <strong>Dr. Guanglie Zhang</strong>) and research staff in the MBE department during the summer, they designed a magnetic-based, self-powered, wireless, fluid-flow meter that could be retrofitted into factory pipes and plumbing. Their sensor could be remotely read using a smartphone app, without any modifications to the existing smartphone hardware.<p>
						
						<p style="text-align: justify">
						Based on the originality of this solution submitted in their written report, they were invited to deliver a presentation at the final competition which was held at ABB China’s general headquarters in Universal Plaza, Beijing, on 27 September 2013.  Only eighteen teams, mostly from other top engineering schools such as Tsinghua University, Tongi University, Xi’an Jiaotong University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, were invited to the final competition. The CityU team was awarded a second place prize.  The 2<sup>nd</sup> place prize includes an automatic second-round interview into ABB’s China Management Trainee Program, and a cash reward of 10,000 RMB.</p>
