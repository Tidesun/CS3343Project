      <h1>Research Degree Programmes</h1>
		<h2>哲學碩士及哲學博士研究課程</h2>
		

<p>
Research experience, with its training in logic and critical thinking, is necessary for many senior posts in industry; it is particularly valuable to those who plan to make their careers in research institutes, industrial research, teaching, or university life.</p>
<p>
Suitably qualified graduates from universities or related institutions in Hong Kong or abroad may be accepted for postgraduate programmes for PhD or MPhil by research. Applicants for research degree studies should show the ability to pursue research in the proposed field of advanced study.</p>
<p>
Full-time and part-time options are available for the research degrees. The part-time option is intended for students who are working full-time in local industry or as a research support staff in the Department. The study duration of research degree programmes is as follows:</p>

      <table>
        <caption></caption>
        <tbody>
          <tr class="odd">
            <th scope="row">Programme of Study</th>
            <td><strong>Full-time</strong></td>
            <td><strong>Part-time</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row" style="font-weight: normal;">MPhil</th>
            <td>2 years</td>
            <td>4 years</td>

            <td>8 years</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
	        
<p>These higher degrees are awarded on the basis of independent but supervised research in a topic approved by the School of Graduate Studies, the submission of a thesis which describes the work the student has carried out, an oral examination, and a written qualifying examination (for PhD students only).</p>
		
<p>Each student takes up an individual research investigation, under the supervision of a faculty member and his or her progress will be overseen by a Qualifying Panel chaired by his or her supervisor.</p>
     
<p>The research degrees consist of a combination of coursework and research studies leading to the submission of a thesis. A candidate is normally required to take a certain amount of <a href="http://www.cityu.edu.hk/pg/current/catalogue/catalogue_R.htm?page=R/R_programme_index.htm">coursework <img src="img\logos\book_icon.jpg" /></a> in the form of taught courses. Coursework requirements which are recommended by the Qualifying Panel may be determined on the basis of the specific needs of a research student. The objectives of this requirement are to help a candidate to improve his or her research techniques and skills, to provide him or her with a better and deeper understanding of the subjects, concepts and methodology in relation to his or her area of research, to help him or her in the preparation of a Qualifying Report and the thesis, and to enable him or her to satisfy all the requirements for the research degree for which he or she is registered.</p>
		
<p>The submission of a Qualifying Report precedes the submission of a thesis. The Qualifying Report is a detailed survey of relevant literature in respect of a specific research topic, and contains information on the methodology and the results aimed at. Full-time candidates will be required to submit the Qualifying Report within 12 months from the commencement of studies.</p>

<p>PhD students are required to take and pass a qualifying examination within 10-24 months (full-time) or 20-48 months (part-time) after commencement of PhD studies. The qualifying examination aims to test students’ knowledge of major subject area of their research disciplines and assess their readiness to conduct research in their specific research discipline. The qualifying examination shall consist of written examination. A maximum of two attempts will be allowed. Those who fail the qualifying examination after two attempts will be recommended for termination of study.</p>

<p>Owing to the rapid growth of scientific knowledge and application of technology, research students are also encouraged to attend research seminars and colloquia held in the Department. However, most of a research student's time is expected to be spent in his or her research project.</p>
		
<p><strong>Financial assistance:</strong></p>
<p>
Generous studentships, scholarships, and grants are available to well qualified research students. The conditions necessary to qualify a student for an award vary, but most of our current students are supported by studentship and research activities/conference grants. For detailed information about financial awards and assistance, please refer to the <a class="cityu-link-pdf" href="http://www.cityu.edu.hk/sgs/download/rpg/prospective/handbook.pdf">Admissions Handbook</a> issued by the School of Graduate Studies.</p>
      
<br /><br /><p>If you are considering undertaking a research degree programme, you should contact a <a href="staff-acad.htm">faculty member</a> of the Department in your proposed area of work who may eventually become your supervisor before you submit a full online application through the School of Graduate Studies.  Qualified applications supported by the proposed supervisor will then be forwarded to the School of Graduate Studies’ Committee on Research Degrees Candidature for decision, via the College Graduate Studies Committee, subject to the academic performance of applicants, as well as the availability of intake quota and funding support.</p>
		
<p>Below is an open letter from the current Research Degree Coordinator for all prospective applicants:</p><br />


	  
<h3>An open letter for prospective applicants</h3><br />

<blockquote>
				  
<p><em>Dear Prospective Research Students,</em><br /><br />

Re: Research Degree Studies, <em>Department of Biomedical Engineering</em><br /><br />

As the Research Degree Coordinator, I am in charge of postgraduate research studies and related matters in the Department.  This letter briefly explains our research degree application procedures.  Details about CityU's research degree programmes and regulations may be found on the CityU <a href="http://www.cityu.edu.hk/sgs/">School of Graduate Studies' website</a> or in its <a class="cityu-link-pdf" href="http://www.cityu.edu.hk/sgs/download/rpg/prospective/handbook.pdf">Admissions Handbook for Research Degree Programmes</a>.<br /><br />

Although CityU is a relatively young university in Hong Kong, it is vibrant and of high academic standing, being ranked 55th in the <a class="cityu-link-external" href="https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2019">QS World University Rankings 2019</a> and ranked 34th (1st in Hong Kong) in Biomedical Engineering according to the <a class="cityu-link-external" href="http://www.shanghairanking.com/Shanghairanking-Subject-Rankings/biomedical-engineering.html">Academic Ranking of World Universities - Global Ranking of Academic Subjects 2018</a>. We have committed staff and excellent facilities. Our postgraduate infrastructure is designed to provide a richly conducive research environment and a full research experience for the individual research student. CityU offers postgraduate studentship stipend to excellent PhD candidates. In addition, tuition scholarship and conference grant are also available. Government-funded PhD places with studentship are limited and therefore highly competitive. Suitably qualified candidates can also apply for admission as self-financed research students without studentship.<br /><br />

While applications are received throughout the year, applicants are advised to observe the application deadline for the main admission round in December every year. Applications received afterwards may be considered subject to the availability of student places and funding support. Interested applicants are required to submit their application <a href="http://www.sgs.cityu.edu.hk/prospective/apply/procedures">on-line</a> through the School of Graduate Studies.  The first thing you will need to do is to identify one or more topic(s)/area(s) you would like to research into and the respective faculty member in this Department who may be your research supervisor. You are strongly advised to contact the potential supervisor(s) directly and discuss with him/her/them about the proposed research and funding support for your studies before you submit your application with the required supporting documents.<br /><br />

Please note that for applicants who have graduated from universities where English is not the language of instruction, a minimum TOEFL score of 550 (paper-based) or 213 (computer-based) or 79 (internet-based); or an overall band score of 6.5 in the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) are normally required for government-funded places.<br /><br />

Applicants with outstanding qualities of academic performance, research ability/potential, communication and interpersonal skills, and leadership abilities are encouraged to apply for the <a href="http://www.sgs.cityu.edu.hk/prospective/rpg/hkphd/">Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme</a>.<br /><br /></p>
