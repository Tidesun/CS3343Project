						<h3 id="MBFC">International Conference on Solid Wastes 2015: Knowledge Transfer for Sustainable Resource Management (ICSWHK2015) 
(20-23 May 2015)</h3>
<p>AERC is one of the supporting organizations for the ICSWHK2015. The conference is organzied by Sino-Forest Applied Research Centre for Pearl River Delta Environment (ARCPE),Hong Kong Baptist University. It will be held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) from 20-23 May 2015. 
 About the conference:
 Currently many Governments are facing hectic pressure due to increasing waste generation and diverse nature of wastes. However, solutions for their treatment and disposal are not simple owing to the increasing diversity of the waste that necessitates appropriate technologies. Ironically, many solutions, including social and technological, do not have universal applicability; and region specific modifications are required. Such modifications in the technology and practices need efficient knowledge transfer and be discussed in a forum with the characteristics of different regions to develop model practices and subsequent appraisal of the success stories to be adapted elsewhere that can save lots of resources across boundaries. With this preamble and the success of the past two conferences in 2011 and 2013, the “International Conference on Solid Waste 2015: Knowledge Transfer for Sustainable Resource Management” will provide a perfect platform for the stakeholders from academia, industries, governments, NGOs and the public to deliberate on various issues related to sustainable waste management practices. It will definitely enhance our understanding leading to effective and sustainable management of wastes. 
 </p>
						<p>The conference covers the following themes:
 <br>1. Sustainable solid waste management practices - Countries perspectives
						<br>2. Waste collection, segregation and characterization
 					   <br>3. Innovative strategies for waste separation, recycling and recovery
 					   <br>4. Sustainable waste utilization & recycling methods
 					   <br>5. Bioenergy and bioproducts from waste (anaerobic digestion, biofuels, etc)
 					   <br>6. Biomass production from waste & carbon sequestration (composting, biochar, etc)
 					   <br>7. Thermal technologies for waste treatment – Trend & development
 					   <br>8. Landfill management & leachate treatment
 <br>9. Hazardous, industrial and special waste management
 <br>10. Electronic waste management, treatment and pollution abatement
 <br>11. Life cycle assessment of waste management practices
 <br>12. Waste management industry - Market potential
 <br>13. Economic instruments and financing methods for waste management
 <br>14. Environmental education for waste management industry and community 
 <br>15. Environmental quality and climate change
